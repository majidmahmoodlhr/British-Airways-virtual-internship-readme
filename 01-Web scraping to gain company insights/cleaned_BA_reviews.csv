0, the ba first lounge at terminal was a zoo at pm dirty tables and used tableware everywhere worse than this the usual atrocious boarding gate service and boarding started mins late the flight was operated by a finnair a which is barely low cost standard let alone business class hard thin uncomfortable seats poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty i remain shocked that ba allow this and its time for bas ceo and management focused on standards rather than bean counting finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous but they provide a very trimmed down budget airline type service as the whole trip turned out to be and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips i thought post covid that ba were better for a few months but with the many cost cuts they are making they fall well below all other european full service airlines
1,paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant i paid over for a business class round trip i went into the to ba lounge in terminal which was very crowded being in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering the cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate b and waited there for mins boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in a and c seat b was blocked out which acted as an additional table there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in terms on no frills it would not cost ba that much to supply business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight the inflight magazine is no longer available there are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment the inflight wifi was flaky at best and nonexistent at other times i was glad it was only a two hour flight i really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money
2,words fail to describe this last awful flight baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight lhrsfo its understandable for a baby to cry nonstop but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep always difficult anyway westbound the food was so bad that most turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the nd service what happened to the really nice tea and scones ive said this before after suffering through the ba concept of customer service ie dont do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work this time i swear i mean it never again on ba please the lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat poor ba is on the skids downhill
3,absolutely terrible experience the app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for covid documents but then did not accept them even when provided i was trying to fly back to the usa where i am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors i went to british airways customer service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger even though i was there in plenty of time this was also during an industrial action at heathrow meaning the number of flights were limited i was delayed over hours in returning to the usa all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport
4,ba overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer it means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage makes easyjet and ryanair look like customer champions the server in itsu in the ba terminal says she stopped flying ba years ago due to the service being bad all the time most customers she serves have a complaint staff dont care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence
5,the flights were all on time except belfast from london which never is the staff were efficient my issue is the app i could not book seats to tel aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay so ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight the seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so i wasted my money on pe seat you can get hold of ba customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just wont use them again
6,only the second time flying ba as first time wasnt positive could have made my connection in heathrow if ba had been proactive instead overnight at the renaissance hotel compliments of ba adequate but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers if ba had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving we could have made our flight and saved ba the cost of rebooking hotel shuttle food accommodations another bad show business class fare should offer more
7,i wasnt going to bother reviewing this flight as i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise after having our flight class reduced from first to business then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment they then reneged on this as it was a special anniversary it sucked flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats unbelievable the flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable this meant no predeparture drinks and a limited selection of food the crew was great but what an earth is going on at ba they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time i say this as the new club suites are great
8,i booked business class tickets for my fianc and i i had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change so i called to get have my flight refunded the representative on the phone informed me he wasnt sure how much i would get as the refund department needed to check but estimated i would lose of my booking to fees i accepted i never got a cancellation email or any update but instead received total back less than of my booking costs since then i have spent over hours calling different departments before they blocked me ive lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show
9,i will never travel with british airways again i spent over on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk first the boeing cabin has seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wakes up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you second the food was disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet was tiny fifth the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for hours and i had to pay more no free airport transfers with british airways seventh the charging points did not work the second leg to london was on a larger plane with seats across the aisle that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is i paid it but note that there were only seats left this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered there is no point paying for business class in british airways
10,i am already in portugal so contacted them today and they cancelled my return flight because i was minutes late calling them even though i tried for hours to get through the day before now i am unable to get back and they have kept the pounds customer service is shocking they have no intention of helping you
11,terrible avoid this airline its now becoming regular practice to cancel flights had a cancellation from switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to spain the airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices
12,despite being a gold member the british airways staff in heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service all the staff members repeat the same mantra we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first hours as if that would make the situation better there are no proactive updates no empathy no care but a lot of actual lies being told you can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals they show this in every action and word they say all of them are better suited to working away from other humans
13,regarding the aircraft and seat the business class seats on this flight were pretty good all were of the suite type where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy the downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple its quite difficult to interact there is ample storage and usb charging ports the seat is pretty comfortable as someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights this was one of the only times ive been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there the amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines the leather toiletry bag was quite nice though no slippers only a pair of socks the restrooms on the flight are very small and dont provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines no free wifi in business class is not acceptable another example of bas penny pinching in recent years regarding the staff and customer service poor inattentive beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there was also no offer of any snacks rude at times my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty the attendant was incredibly rude in response this left us shocked different customers seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service the food was pretty bad i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the vegetables were discoloured and flavourless the bread was nice though the breakfast wasnt much better summary ba has become the ryanair of long haul the customer service is way below what i would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat you pay a premium price for a very average service if there are other options available i would choose them over ba these days
14,i travelled with british airways from sweden to los angeles via london in december when i arrived at lax one of my bags were missing there was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about minutes i found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind i gave her my details of where i would be staying and she told me that they would contact me after a few days and still no contact i tried to call british airways customer service the woman at the airport didnt give me a file reference number so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days i told them that i had switched hotels and gave them the address for where i was staying and everything was fine but then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home at the airport i tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel i stayed at even though i had given them an updated address i asked them what i should to since i was flying home now the guy at the counter told me that it wasnt his problem and that i should figure it out myself i questioned him about his response and he just walked away a manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one i came home and a couple of days later i received my bag i made a complaint and claims on british airways website since i had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because i didnt have my bag in january they said that they would refund me for my claims it is now april almost may and i have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations i dont know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me i am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at british airways and the lack of customer service
15,food was lousy who ever is planning the asian hindu vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes the snack was also lousy it took us hours just to go from t to t and clear security check the place was chaotic we get to our boarding gate and again a long line with minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding pass seats in premium economy was ok but when the passenger in front reclines there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over overall not a good airline
16,had the worst experience the flight from london to toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to halifax we were four including an infant and a toddler aged years despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful we waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own very nice of you british airways at least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation we will not to travel on this airline again
17,the ground staff were not helpful felt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway travelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with british airways logged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answer lost some of our luggage it was not a good experience
18,second time ba premium economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in hong kong this was a very pleasant flight seats are spacious and comfortable in premium economy in this layout attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good they communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind a very pleasant experience in ba premium economy after a major disappointment in club world earlier this year
19,they changed our flights from brussels to london heathrow to lax on we paid extra to choose our seats since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought they seated us in totally different seats i asked the check in employee she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight from london to lax was worse nobody in the airport help us employees from ba told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal and sleep there finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel it was a nightmare this airline we missed one day work and ba didnt return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats
20,at copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlines time on board never changed no fixed counter at airport abysmal service that needs vast improvement here
21,worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for british airways so many issues with getting from one destination to the other had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties i wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic we are sorry email with avios attached which is equivalent to maybe on a flight needless to say these will go to waste as i refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldnt even address one single issue expressed to them it was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face i will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive the most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss
22,due to code sharing with cathay pacific i was downgraded to ba on my return leg i cant describe how cheated i felt i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment food and service instead i was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible to ensure the passengers didnt get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way you wont get anything else for hours you know the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movies so i paid for wifi so i could watch netflix on my laptop unsurprisingly the signal was so weak i couldnt even send an email to add insult to injury the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful what i dont understand is why it seems that british airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew
23,lhr check in was quick at the first wing and quickly through security the first lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available while ba have brought back their highlife magazine in the lounge it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer as part of the endless ba cost cutting the toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about years out of date the public washrooms in t are better and cleaner boarding was the usual ba muddled mess and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight requesting passengers to check in bags only to get on a flight that was less than full onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only mins late breakfast had choices and was a fair standard no hot towels or even packet towels offered in club europe any more another part of the relentless ba cost cutting i wouldnt mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid cabin staff service was perfunctory at best not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald members clear proof that ba really dont care any more breakfast trays cleared mins into the flight and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight paid for hours wifi and dropped connection for the next mins sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga this is standard for ba business class baggage handling do not waste your money on club europe standards just keep dropping
24,i wouldnt recommend british airways at all i tried to call to customer service for times in different days and time and i waited for more than minutes on the phone i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls i write an email an i am still waiting for weeks website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you dont receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely wouldnt recommend it is such a shame that in they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around
25,absolutely horrible experience i booked a ticket from expedia for a british airways operated flight from madrid to belfast with a changeover at london heathrow the whole itinerary was listed as ba although the madrid to london flight was iberia on jan nd london was experiencing cold and fog the iberian flight sat on the tarmac for hours in madrid because of the london weather upon landing in terminal i had to take a bus to terminal the flight was the last flight to belfast for the evening and it had already taken off the ba desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather the british airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to pounds and we would be reimbursed i was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab however when trying to get the reimbursement ba said it wasnt their problem and that it was iberias problem iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather when complaining to ba they said they only market the flight as ba and that they refuse to reimburse absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but dont want to take responsibility for it did they expect me to take the bus back to terminal their people gave out false information
26,this is the worst airline not one thing went right i dont understand how they have got it so bad late take off no gate when we arrived bags took over minutes to arrive horrendous
27,i will never fly british airways again to start the plane was over hours late with no weather and no reason given the boarding process was chaotic both in the airport and onto the plane but more importantly although we were in business class it wasnt really business class there were a few aisles not separated in any wayin which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there and those seats like the rest were extremely cramped and uncomfortable i could not believe they called this business class
28,worst aircraft i have ever flown the seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a hour flight is not acceptable my food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile i would not entertain using ba again ground staff were great its the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down we expected so much more
29,i enjoyed my flight the boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional the food selection was good and i enjoyed the quality the was only one downside when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at t so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took minutes i believe the heathrow t were having strike action that week
30,why do you make it so hard after a so so lounge experience the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt it cant be training who would do that it has to be no fear of anything happening the new club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy the crew were professional but i personally found the food menu rather odd essentially there was one only main that i could handle and was then told they had ran out i was a few rows in
31,after several delays and canceled flights we finally made it to copenhagen on american airlines and british airways flights my luggage was destroyed wheels torn off i had to buy new luggage in denmark i made a claim with british airways to reimburse me but because i didnt have the receipt for my old luggage they would only cover of my new luggage advice have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you dont get ripped off like i did
32,literally the worst flight of my life after booking tickets together with my partner we were then separated sorry the flight is full the flight then took off minutes late no apology the trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows and the response was flippant and rude whoops not sure how that happened what do you want genuinely appalling from beginning to end might as well fly easy jet at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service not like ba
33,i swore i would never fly ba again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to budapest but the times for their flights suited me so i decided to give them another go the flight left on time just about the cabin was clean and the staff friendly there was even complimentary teacoffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy the flight was pleasant enough and i cant think of any negatives to write about the flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet
34,obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really dont need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldnt want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious
35,lost out of checked bags denied wheelchair assistance at lhr for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot rude staff on ba from lhr to ord on april ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water when walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely the ba staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat horrible flight with disappointing staff customer service is terrible and online checkin never worked because ba never verified our covid documents which were uploaded in advance resulting me and my wife seated separately ive lost respect for british airways disgusted
36,i have flown with ba for many years and there was a time about years ago when they were getting better sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines at booking time one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat at heathrow t check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least the lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and ba has not invested in them for many years on the flight the food was okay although portions are kept minimal this was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight next time they change ceo can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate budget irish airline
37,boarding at mumbai was chaotic and badly organised once on board the crew announcements were professional relaxed and informative in typical ba style the seat was quite comfortable it was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good i was lucky that the middle seat was empty so i didnt suffer from the new narrow seat which i think would have made it a lot less comfortable the ife is excellent responsive and good quality there is an enormous selection of tv and movies and a good number of games wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i dont think for full flight is bad value you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient catering was reasonable although on a near hr flight the small but tasty pastry for the second meal service wasnt really enough landing and processing at heathrow was astonishingly quick it felt like it was am even though it was pm no queues or waiting at all even the baggage was super quick at coming through overall a very solid experience in economy significantly better than it used to be
38,mexico city airport is a zoo but taking the late departure on ba to lhr isnt too bad club passengers can use the aa admirals lounge which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to bas club passengers only at this time of day lovely staff solid food bar really pleasant we flew an older with the old style club seats seated in the front cabin just rows of club in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner come to think of it i will really miss this old style once cutting edge layout there is no better way to fly when you are a couple we were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle still terrible you have to pay for these seats but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats flying ba when the crew is good is amazing service was impecable on this flight just the right mix of humor service and attention food seemed to be good as well but hardly touched it i am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better on time departure smooth flight and early arrival at heathrow we went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track security at lhr has always been terrible but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without secundary checks we had a lovely shower at the spa what a fabulous facility the south lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture what a mess food on offer was solid and so are the drinks our home stretch to amsterdam was pretty straight forward lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent barcart service i love the doubleservings of drinks english tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and i really dont understand ba stuck to it through the years noone like the cucumber white bread things but hey on time landing in amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a minute late arrival why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in amsterdam flying club in ba is still wonderful i love it
39,very poor service very frustrating firstly my flight to lhr was cancelled on mar while i got a text message to inform me the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam once this was confirmed i went to the counter to get my new boarding pass at the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in mins for the hotel we me and other fellow travelers waited for over mins there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions the transfer hotel was mins away from the airport when we got to the hotel which is around pm the staff informed that dinner closes at that was a rush it appeared more of a motel than an hotel the room was smelling of weed being a nonsmoker this was uncomfortable although i wanted to compromise and rest when i went to wash my face the tap on the sink came off in my hands i panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room after some discussion they agreed to change it i went to the alternate room to my horror it was occupied i asked the staff to call a cab and i left
40,generally poor sent to gate on time sat maybe minutes was then announced as crew were not familiar with the a there would be a delay clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement watched the crew walk through to the gate my impression was they did not want to be there was given a miniscule amount of water small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were us no further updates or sight of crew for next two hours then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water when i said this should be complimentary girl said it was not her problem and walked away
41,ba changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to select new seats flight took off late cabin crew served a tiny packet of pretzels arrived at heathrow late put on a remote stand loaded onto buses to terminal held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff allowed passengers at a time because of a trial queued at security for minutes
42,flew from london heathrow to marrakech ba changed our pre paid seats at the last minute and even charged us to select other seats boarding was chaos staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold i had one small bag however they never demanded other passengers with bags and some with hand luggage that was obviously too big flight was late taking off and the snack was a miserable tiny packet of cheese pretzels this airline is going downhill rapidly
43,i was meant to fly in january to algeria i paid over for the ticket just a few days before i was meant to fly my wife broke her foot i had to then rebook it in march and pay another i called british airways weeks before my flight in march and i told them again that it had to me rebooked as my wife was still not well they told me that i dont have to pay anything to get it rebooked as i sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasnt well however they never sent me the ticket they made me wait for nearly weeks and they asked me to pay either on top of the that i paid previously or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of tax only i found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money i previously paid each time i call them they hang up on me or they continue telling me to pay i made a complaint and nothing happened
44,we have flown repeatedly with british airways and the one world alliance over the last few weeks every flight was delayed now we are back at the airport in miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flight finally our luggage arrived in puerto rico with a day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip we havent received any information about our luggage to this day luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there the last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they cant do anything wir sind in den letzten wochen immer wieder mit britisch airways und dem one world zusammenschluss geflogen jeder flug war versptet nun sitzen wir wieder in miami am flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive versptung sodass wir unseren anschlussflug verpassen werden zuletzt ist auch unser gepck mit tagen versptung in puerto rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren rundreise umplanen wir haben bis heute noch keine info ber unser gepck erhalten zum glck haben wir selbst am flughafen nachgesehen und es war da beim letzten verpspteten flug meinte die kabinen crew dass auch sie ihre anschlussflge verpassen und wir im selben flugzeug sitzen und sie knnen nichts machen
45,i was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant the seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own or else you are breathing in the head scalp of the person in front of you food was revolting they dont even provide napkins unless you ask with the premeal drinks and the secondary meal the last time i flew ba it was a completely other experience and i was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid it was really majorly disappointing and i regret that i have already purchased other intercontinental trips with the company i will now have to see if i can change them the pathetic ml bottle of water its just a sip on the shorter flights the seats couldnt even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost hours and we had to wait on board
46,the worst cabin experience ever cramped seats very low cost style and uncomfortable could suit for short flights but not for a hours service catering is also a shame ml of water a chocolate bar for a hours service will never fly ba again
47,first time flying with british airways and first time flying to the americas from india via london heathrow i chose premium economy at a reasonable price i was quite comfortable however the first leg of the flight from mumbai to heathrow the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest the second leg from heathrow to nassau the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable cabin service was fine i appreciated that they didnt come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping the meals werent that great to be honest after landing in heathrow we had to wait on the tarmac for minutes waiting for an open gate my connection was less than an hour long the ba staff in the heathrow airport helped me move through security quickly and i made it with time to spare for my next flight when i arrived in nassau i found that my luggage didnt make it due to the short connection time in london the ba baggage representative in nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim my luggage arrived on the next ba flight a few days later and british airways nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island i was staying on very impressive and efficient
48,the latest affront stood in first class line for an hour finally go up front and the ba agent let supposed vips with large tobechecked bags in front of all of us arrogant and unapologetic add this to a long list of postcovid disappointments we are done with ba
49,booked a flight return flight between london and munich for to in december the return flight was cancelled and rebooked from to british airways only notified me of the first change but not the second getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions each time needing to find a helpful representative british airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket they tried to charge an change fee through repeatedly calling back british airways reinstated my flight on and then again on to make sure it did not get changed again i checked the status of my ticket daily from to it was intact those days on when it was time to checkin for the flight it was gone at the airport the staff at the british airways checkin counter are not ba employees so cannot help resolve problems there are no ba representative at the munich airport the confirmation documentation from british airways was of no value i was left stranded at the airport
50,i tried to check in on line and was informed that this was not possible i was given no reason for this i telephoned ba customer service and must have wasted nearly hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information staff need customer training better knowledge of their product and some manners ba customer service was virtually non existent i will never fly with them again
51,a catalogue of failures we flew from belfast to heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours we missed our onward air canada flight to calgary as a result on arriving in calgary after rerouting via vancouver which added over hours to our journey we met other passengers who had also missed the same air canada flight as their british airways flight from manchester had also been delayed by several hours we are now on our way home only to find our heathrow to belfast flight which had already been cancelled and put back hours is now delayed by another hours avoid british airways like the plague
52,our flight out to dubrovnik was at the painful time of in the morning and from london gatwick not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum hrs before to be ready to board i understand why the likes of easyjet ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone outbound lgwdbv boarding was fairly quick easy and efficient and we took off on time pilot announcements clear professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the pinnacle seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour messy illfitting uniforms and unclassy makeup toilets clean and maintained appreciate antibacterial wipes being kept available postcovid inbound dbvlgw for some reason no online or app checkin available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities no queue at manual checkin though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful proactively offered to take our larger handluggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport was empty at that hour with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for minutes for no reason its truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off pilots for this flight were unpolished with unclear announcements during the flight one couldnt even remember where we flying back to no apology for delay cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary seats for this flight were horrendous and the new slimline ones ba are installing from row onwards these seats have barely any padding so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable we landed minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise wed been stranded for hours wed spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot given because in the context of the shorthaul market thats what they deserve we fly ba as we dont fly the lowcost carriers after so many bad experiences but its by no measure good just the least bad option given point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard
53,if i could give a minus rating i would supposed to be lhrams at on th march get to lhr at email to say flight cancelled no one able to help at lhr said to use the app only halfway sensible option was from lcyams at so taxi over there as trains from lhr not working ok not bas fault get to lcy showing as cancelled on screen so check the app and there it is rebook again via the app to the departure go to desk to drop bag and was told that i was only on standby for the flight with no guarantee of a seat despite the app telling me it was confirmed the to ams was already overbooked so was moved onto the flight to rotterdam the and were both cancelled anyway as it happened eventually took off and the best thing i can say is that it landed intact return from amslhr similar story arrive at ams screen shows the is cancelled quickly check app and confirmed it was no emails no texts nothing rebooked via app to the departure so could have been worse desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight overall dreadful they just dont care and hide behind apps and automated call centres avoid unless you have no other option and even then stop and consider if you really need to go
54,plane was over an hour late leaving no problem that can happen but on arrival at heathrow the plane sits on the runway for minutes as there was no free stand to go to then once at the stand we waited another minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the plane just pathetically inefficient
55,we were flying world traveller plus their premium service what it was not was premium we have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly premium most times bas premium is the worst i have come across the flight from heathrow to jfk was just ok the flight back was in a plane that should not be used old dirty uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had one would not recline and one reclined without using the button ba needs to look at the premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs they have fallen far behind their competitors they were once my preferred airline but now i try and avoid at all costs i would rather pay more and fly with someone else
56,this was literally one of the worst experiences i havent been to an airport since it began in orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for hours poor customer service and just ignored at times then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags even though i booked through to dublin another hours i was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight another hour later i was handed a card with a number and told to ring it i was cut off three times and told i wouldnt be able to get home that day despite several flights being available just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for christmas and missed an engagement party
57,the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on th february at this happened to be our first flight with our newborn month old daughter it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence just under hrs before scheduled departure the original th february flight was cancelled we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express id booked a day of holiday off work for this trip we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead on the way back from the cancelled flight both me and my wife tried calling ba despite one of us having silver membership possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there i took us nearly minutes to speak to someone who could help i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human we often received the response similar to computer says no if this is the service level for silver members i cant imagine what a regular punter has to put up with when the phone originally connected to a person i had to wait minutes as his computer booted up ba then proceeded to autobook us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination our original flight was to munich and the autobooked replacement flight was to salzburg when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location km apart they couldnt understand my frustration eventually someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at not ideal as id wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldnt refund us or move our booking but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg the day of the new flight came round and this time we managed to get all the way to the check in desk upon arriving at the check in desk we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled minutes earlier no email no text no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook at this point i didnt know whether to explode with anger or cry luckily another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us we were booked onto another flight later that evening ba unfortunately that meant hrs in the grotty lounge with a month old baby it appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so theres really no difference between the lounge and a hostel other than you get free stuff in the former this was not a pleasant experience we did eventually arrive in munich and despite asking didnt get our push chairstroller delivered to the front of the plane the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too all in all another shocking ba service a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathysympathyunderstanding at all from any of the employees i interacted with
58,lost my case and took weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after weeks i had a business class flight scheduled on dec manchester copenhagen bangkok and return flight dec bangkok stockholm manchester sas airlines left manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control when i arrived in copenhagen to get the connecting flight for bangkok we were minutes too late and the flight had gone half of the plane missed it sas airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being copenhagen sas london ba dubai emirates bangkok i returned from copenhagen to london and the collected my boarding pass at ba we were over hours late leaving london due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight we arrived in dubai late and was informed the flight had gone emirates then informed me that i had to speak with thai air to get another flight issued i spent over an hour phoning thai air with nobody picking up the phone i then spoke with thai air dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that i buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later i paid for a kuwait airways flight out of dubai kuwaiti bangkok whilst in dubai i checked with kuwait airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from london and they would locate it and forward to my bangkok address the following day my baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage forms i arrived back home yesterday and was informed by ba that they have found my bag in london
59,the incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because french air traffic controllers were on strike so we were routed over germany and not bas fault o arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance it took around minutes to find someone then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge all told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate total disruption wasted time absolutely no excuse for this
60,back in december my family and i as we were getting onto the plane were refused even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked months in advance we were refused it turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldnt let all the passengers on the plane so quite randomly not people were selected and turned away we were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances if i had connecting flights in london etc i sought compensation from ba which i was told i could do and what an absolute nightmare this process has been they wouldnt acknowledge my complaint for my family until i had an authorisation letter from them saying i could act on their behalf even though i booked and paid for the tickets so i uploaded the authorisation letter no less than times every time they told me they received it and every time i followed it up they told me they hadnt there was no other way except to post from australia to the uk to some office eventually it finally go through to them i have now chased up the reimbursement four times each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient today they tell me that they need to check my account details so again i send them the same information that i have done before and i wait patiently for my reimbursement i am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away well you know what i wont
61,as usual the flight is delayed this week it already hours and im held on a bus waiting to get taken to the plane i really cant explain how much i detest british airways if it was a cheap budget airline i could accept it but its premium prices for the most unreliable service
62,a short ba euro trip and this is where ba excel clean aircraft good crew professional on time within lhr standards and a good value product delivered pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food options but good overall check in self service is great now once you know how to use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who cant
63,we are flying business class for most of our flight and then premium economy for the balance in addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional pp for our seats now ba is changing planes they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas my wife i when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one of us additional to be reseated next to each other they moved our seats away from each other and we shouldnt have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together we havent even flown yet this airline is horrible
64,i am in australia and on friday night went online to book a flight from heathrow to malpensa milan i did not realise that when i specifically searched for flights to malpensa it offered options to other airports in milan when i received my itinerary by email it was to another airport in milan the itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the hour cooling off period as it was the weekend here i was unable to reach their office until monday when they advised me there was no refund other than fees as i had missed the hour cooling off period apparently as the ticket was issued in the uk i needed to contact them i have now cancelled the ticket and i will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying british airways
65,at am on the day of travel whilst driving to london heathrow i received an email advising my flight had been cancelled i was offered an alternative flight with american airlines which i had no alternative but to accept as i must travel today i was flying to la to see a family member who is end of life the american airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy tried times ba provide telephone number total useless no help given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email i have been a ba frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer i now find i am travelling hours in economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade this is completely unacceptable what has happened to this company i have had better treatment from ryanair
66,would happily fly them again i had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge onboard service on lhrist was no frills but jfklhr was impeccable good food lots of moviescds on the ife open bar service the entire flight friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drinksnack
67,flew premium only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room penny pinching means theres no other benefit one drink service on hour flight no fizz offered before take off poor food boarding was badly organised food left on tables min before landing with no tea and coffee offered few small cups of water passed around but nothing premium about this new planes have been decorated terribly feels like youre in a dentist waiting room devoid of any personality or joy only fly if the only option only fly premium if its not too expensive seriously not worth much more than economy these days especially if youre in the middle 
68,first our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable however it lost us one days experience in cairo we were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats on both flights as my husband had spasms he had to stretch his legs across my lap and not once did any of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling as the service came to us for food each choice we made we were told they were all out and we had to settle for what they had left i did the correct thing once home and sent in my complaints they responded with a pound voucher for our group
69,although it was a bit uncomfortable flight in an economy the flight attendants made the flight the best possibly could such a nice and professional crew very attentive and looking out for their customers
70,boarding was decently organised the a still has the rather strange configuration in club world where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite position the a was nearly full rather poor amenity bag the welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantry the meal was ok but not great aside the champagne no european wines on this flight service was friendly but rather slow no spontaneous refills of drinks offered acceptable continental style breakfast extremely narrow restrooms without any lotions or similar it was an acceptable experience nothing more after landing minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority
71,boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to london heathrow that is very ok the a with rather narrow seats in business light meal a caesars salad a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks nothing wrong for such a short flight fas were very friendly and landing on time
72,my original flight was cancelled just over weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available british airways affected the trip i planned it feels like ba is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service
73,delayed just for a change poor communication british airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline customer service is impossible to contact and it seems ba tries hard to hide any possible email communication address when its available
74,very competent check in staff saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted i could not take exit seat moved me to row where the middle seat was empty on the other hand on board huge line for toilets min into a min flight a crew member realised one of the toilets is closed as crew had put their luggage there they announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow on asking why they did not give us enough cups for hot drinks and the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip a bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar
75,check in was so slow no self check in and bag drop boarding was ok flight totally full booked row which was ok some space in overhead bins seat and legroom ok cabin crew ok smiled gave out the bottle of water and pretzels flight itself was ok landed mins early and then waited minutes for a stand and ground crew bags came off reasonably quickly ba still seems to believe it is something special a premium carrier the reality is that it is not the only reason we flew ba was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year ba is our carrier of last choice
76,my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british airways on th february i was due to travel to madrid with british airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled as a result of the information on the website i called british airways and have minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you she refused to let me and about other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to go online to rebook your seat i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport must be wrong he then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the checkin line and told a checkin agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes he gave me a voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it once aboard my new flight the service was minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop
77,this was my first time flying with ba i was pleasantly surprised islamabad via doha was very comfortable and the crew were great friendly and helpful the second flight was operated by qatar airways this was from doha to islamabad my return journey was a direct ba flight kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights crew on this flight were really nice too what let ba down was the food it really was not nice the ife could do with some more content but thats not really a huge issue
78,lots of cancellations and delays and no one apologized edinburgh to london on feb th our original flight was cancelled and the rebooked one was cancelled as well the third rebooked one was supposed to departure at and had several delays until then we had to wait minutes for our luggage to arrive
79,ba on the boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed in flight services were excellent the crews were friendly with excellent service overall very happy with ba
80,not only my first flight in years but also my first time back to england for years i flew from pmilgw on and returned on both wizz air and easyjet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage british airways were the most convenient and best value option available they offered ideal flight times and the charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable total cost for both flights was regular update information via email seamless online seat allocation and check in efficient staff at the check in desks at pmi and lgw ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible immaculate aircraft comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom im tall cabin crew were polite friendly and professional in flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced i enjoyed the meat ploughmans and ipa beer total on both flights i have flown times in the last years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one lgwlhr helicopter transfer flying was a totally different experience back in the day we are now in the age of the budget airline nostalgia aside british airways are the best airline ive flown with
81,my husband and myself were flying to madrid on the rd of february for a legal matter and we had to be in madrid by pm we had booked our flight and car with ba holidays unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before we got lost and missed our am flight to madrid i tried to stay calm cold head and we went to british airways to get help the first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with ba holidays we didnt know that she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldnt do anything else that we had to call that number we called the number which was asking us to call another number which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from am till pm we went back to the lady and explained that we couldnt wait until am but she told us that she could not do anything i did reach out to another staff a lovely young lady called althea she started to look at it made several calls went to check with someone else to an office she managed to get someone to send me a text message that i had to call and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line modified our booking to place us in the following flight at am they didnt charge us for that our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to madrid without the support of the lovely althea her professionalism her care for us we would not have make it she was so sweet so caring but at the same time so determined to help she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities
82,organised boarding process really friendly crew quick drink and a snack all in all a great experience the crew are a credit to ba the best crew in europe
83,outward journey ba london to buenos aires club world january our experience was poor from beginning to end although we had reserved seats f and j another passenger was occupying f and crew made no attempt to address the problem eventually i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat d we boarded punctually but were not offered drinks when i asked for a drink the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem the same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing she asked us to repeat our orders later the hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related my soup was cold i was told it was served from flasks was that an explanation or an excuse my coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules my companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner the breakfast menu stated a selection of rollspastries but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry where he would have chosen a bread roll although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottles of water ran out return journey ba buenos aires to london heathrow world traveller plus january was a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crews professionalism throughout its a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus was so much better and kinder weighed against the advantages of a flat bed the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above
84,check in agent at lhr was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew seat was comfortable with good leg room however the food was poor barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selections were very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money
85,very disappointing i book ba so i can fly during the day my return flight at pm on was cancelled replaced by a flight at pm it took off hour late meaning i arrived at gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections i had to pay for a taxi home plus the seats are really snug im only but my knees were hitting the seat in front no more ba for me they are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated ryanair has better aircraft and takeoff slots
86,excellent service both on the ground and on board while their first class product might not be leading edge the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket the concorde room at heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip flight was slightly delayed out of heathrow but arrived on schedule in johannesburg
87,good lounge at cape town on time departure drinks high quality sound dinner service breakfast reasonable arrival lounge was good but showers cold
88,a really excellent journey lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon plenty of edible food easy boarding new club world suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards choice of individual wines rather than bland blends courses served individually with cut glass and china beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup crew excellent good choice of movies breakfast after a good nights sleep fruits etc first couldnt manage the full english which was offered arrival on time what more could you want not quite up to gulf standards overall but ba seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard
89,this flight was one of the worst i have ever had in my life i wanted to pamper myself so i bought business class i was looking forward to my new experience i will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times as these things may happen what surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers the flight was delayed by almost hours even though staff offered vouchers we had no idea where to get them and we were told that we only had about minutes to use them because boarding had already begun firstly i did not see anyone with the voucher and secondly even if we got it we were not able to use it when i finally got to the airport there was another waiting for about minutes after cross check meantime we were told that due to problems they did not load any food so the flight will be without any food on board the only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts as a business class passenger i was offered drinks only all in all my business class contained small glasses of juice i received no apology or compensation from the company at all it was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price
90,it seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines i cannot even check in because ba requires the submission of documents for covid restrictions however the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken after clicking submit the form just hangs forever no error message is given i tried three different browsers on three different devices all have the same hang which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat i tried using the chat bot but after minutes of clicking try again i thought i had donated enough time to ba
91,as a spanish born individual living in england i have been using british airways for over decades multiple times a year on th january i booked a flight for my son and i to go to alicante however i was informed on the th january by my doctors that i am unable to fly due to an elbow operation i have had as a result i decided to give my ticket to my daughter calling up the customer service team for british airways to make the change on the th january they took my enquiry call there seemed to be some speech delay in the call which presented a small bit of difficulty however i also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay when requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name i was told this is not within the policy and that i would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it i was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers i accepted this and was then asked if i would like to cancel the booking i insisted i would need to know the total of the refund its lucky i did ask to check this as i was then informed it would be roughly the total cost of my booking was which comes to per passenger leaving my refund total at less than of the value of my purchase this is despite the seat not be abandoned according to ba policy all i am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than refund even when im buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone probably for more money than it was worth a week ago
92,a rather empty and quiet flight to tel aviv very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight i had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us otherwise an overall excellent flight on bas part this was the first time i have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time
93,easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to ba security at london was fast galleries north was fine and showers were good organised flight boarding plane was fine with good crew and new club world product my wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok after take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run slept well on time arrival we both found the new seat design harder to sleep in
94,being a silver flyer and booking a flight through ba to dublin you would have thought i could use the lounge even though ba used air lingus for the flight travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind gentleman at the desk even though he said i had to be gold he was really accommodating and it wasnt a big deal but the two ladies on the desk were like no no empathy there at allsaying the other guy shouldnt have let me and they will have a word with him come on ba i booked the flight through you and you made me fly with air lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier
95,i find ba incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers i have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although i know it sounds silly when on a hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage there was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug when i challenged why i had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment i was told it was a short haul fight my sisters met me from cairo which is an hour and half flight and flew egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance drinks food and inflight entertainment as well as a usb port to charge their phones ba i now realise stands for budget airline staff were great what you got for your money not so much
96,flew atl to lhr th jan was unlucky enough to be on board a year old refit gave it a decent ife screen and the seat looked decent although combine the ife with the cheap and nasty earbuds and any movie can be ruined headrest was great just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my wife and i were very uncomfortable the leg room in general is poor especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish zero room aircraft was tired rubber spacers falling out silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets toilet seats old stained rubber on arm rest was hanging off no post take off drinkssnacks offered meal was sent out after a couple of hours was poor chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life stale rock hard roll salad which was rice and carrots dried crackers with no cheese kids meal was just as sad tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck coffee creamer was given with the kids meal snack was decent for the adults bagel with cheese and egg hot and tasty kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it very very poor mix the food ba service with a grunt being crammed into a seat for hours landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and ba in my opinion is terrible this flight was so disappointing other than one great member of cabin crew everything else was just average
97,great thing about british airways a is the economy section upstairs get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats despite being not very old the a looked tired inside broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react ife the food was supposed to be christmas dinner wafer thin bits of dry turkey over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes poor in taste and quality mousse desert was great though slight issue during the snack meal ordered a childs option which was marked as such regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box staff were ok couple decent but mostly just ok overall ba just seems a tad cheap these days great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended just seemed a bit dull and like ba are just an average airline
98,the staff are friendly the plane was cold we were shivering they gave light blankets but they were not enough meals were basic entertainment was basic luggage is delayed today is day and ba staff over the phone say call after hours tracking system is very vague had to extract information from staff that they arrived to vancouver on jan nd i offered to collect baggage but very vague answer call the airport asked her for ba phone number at yvr but she said we dont have a phone number for you to call call the main airport their policy states you can make a claim only after days
99,probably the worst business class experience ive ever had on an airline just a few of the issues required to purchase seats on international club world business class this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional on a single leg lhrlax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba as leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vielhr leg the boarding time for the a was over minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first as were delivered online checkin in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website and did not upload any covid documentation i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vielhr leg the shopbacom page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhrlax leg there was no premeal beverage service and there were no midflight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the prelanding snack of a ploughmans lunch being downright disgusting there was no beverage or bar setup in the galley areas beverages available to passengers during the flight as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water i wont comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery
100,definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i dont know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the persons legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space ive unfortunately traveled british airways business class at least times within the last months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen
101,ba shuttle service across the uk is still surprisingly a good product when compared with ba long haul that doesnt always get the best of comments at times its reasonable priced works well fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk i dont know why they still offer a covid style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service currently they have an on line sky cafe but its too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips
102,i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews but had my first ride on a ba a the other day so it was an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but thats about it ife didnt work but wasnt that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down some skirts some trouser suits some long sleeves some short some jackets some waistcoat some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better i think baggage delivery was really quick summing up well i am still not coming back to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon
103,when will ba update their business class cabin across on a it is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares as for having to pay to reserve a specific seat an antiquated idea the cabin staff were fine food acceptable checkin ok and business lounge breakfast acceptable the lack of space in the seating area small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive
104,paid day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy at checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees took about minutes to resolve seat was nice enough stowage pocket in front a bit small food was reasonably nice shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue ife system is good but selection mediocre worst part of the flight is that at cpt so we were on a remote stand and bussed in through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight upgrade was worth it at maybe its a long flight but their offers of or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing score before the luggage fiasco would have been or with the luggage fiasco i cant rate it more than 
105,ba website did not work weirdly deleted my flight from upcoming flights on the day of departure chaos at cape town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down chaos at the gate no queue management for premium passengers very nice new a with smart new club suite champagne warm cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold which is not true as air france manage it disappointing meal wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives cheese ice cold and tasteless why cant the champagne white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese good ife system but mediocre film selection disappointing breakfast overall flew air france business the month before which was way better so sad whats become of ba
106,absolutely terrible experience with british airways after a short flight from london heathrow to frankfurt they couldnt get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight on cathay pacific to melbourne despite a hour gap between the two flights told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to melbourne instead it got to hong kong and left there when they finally tracked it down they sent it back to london all happened over christmas so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team while the plane crew may be lovely the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful and if given the option i will avoid flying with them in future
107,vancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec nd we received an email on dec th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund he processed the cancellation hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldnt be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there wont be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other arrangements will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard back from the manager as we logged in to checkin hours before take off we found that our van lhr flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional per person price difference and the dates offered were about days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about cancellation fee to get a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the phone for hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out the customer service person would take minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the phone with them for days back and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for
108,old a with narrow pitch flight perfectly on time with constant announcements from cockpit friendly staff free chips and water quick luggage delivery at t
109,another ba shambles started off well with excellent check in at first at t mid afternoon so avoided the early morning evening scrum into the concorde lounge excellent service again great choice of cocktails wine etc food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable called to the boarding gate chaos people jostling for position to get on the plane people with children under called before the people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over we get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all so the lights were on all night it was like being detained and interrogated excellent wine and champagne selection dinner menu handed out ill have the prawn cocktail to start please no you wont as theyve only loaded one for people and the guy in a got it i bet he felt like hed won the lottery ok ill have the beef wellington basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce mains ill have the curry no you wont as theyve substituted that with christmas dinner im going to the maldives to get away from christmas i ended up with short ribs that were inedible no salad starter no water offered no bread roll i just couldnt eat it so basically my husband and i have spent on return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving no apologies watch out ba as virgin start flying direct in october as always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots
110,ba cancelled my flight home to heathrow on dec th on the face of it that was sensible as the weather in iceland was appalling however what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only hours before take off time by which time i was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport i got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad if they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed i am now booked onto the flight on the st and downgraded for my sins having checked today as i type they have not cancelled the flight on the th despite the road to keflavk being closed do they not check these things any help from ba offered not really
111,ba cancelled my flight home the last flight of the day into heathrow and tried to push me onto another flight to london city hours later my car was at heathrow i didnt want to try and cross london late at night on public transport with luggage especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time i had to book a flight home with lufthansa which cost for an economy seat but at least it got me home to heathrow all be it another terminal on the friday night so i could get home to family i still have had no news on a refund of the months on its such a shame flying ba used to be such a pleasurable experience ba have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey weve booked this year we are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service
112,turned up hours in advance terminal at london heathrow was already carnage s of people trying to check in only desks manned long queues at security due to only lines open people stressed pushing shouting and flight delayed by hours according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded missed connecting flight in doha hours wait til next one received a voucher approx for the whole day arrived day later my suitcase didnt arrive with me filed a claim at the desk for days no update no information no offer of compensation and no solution offer i now have a spoilt holiday many personal belongings are gone xmas gifts missing extensive expenses i dont know if i will be reimbursed beware with ba expect low level or zero customer service old planes and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing i will personally avoid ba in future at all costs
113,boarding at gate at lgw they called group to board we were world traveller plus group then called anyone in groups whereupon everyone else surged forward why have numbered boarding groups if you dont use them cabin crew treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane at one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past and without even a word no acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past service we were in the final row of six in wt which has a total of seats the lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served not unusual for back row seats but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the menu options cabin steward said that they had only been given wt meals there was a second hot meal served before we landed again the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left i asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal and she said she hadnt thought of that food some of it was inedible vegetarian cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it the bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half only thing i could eat was the baby bel in between meal snacks consisted of a biscuit pack of shortbread pretty basic drinks they ran out of red wine hours into an hour flight toilets there was no toilet accessible directly from the wt section we had to walk halfway down the plane through economy to reach a shared toilet we flew virgin atlantic months before in equivalent premium economy and it was so much better organised boarding sparkling wine or orange on boarding water or orange in ba food options available even in last row seats better food proper glassescups for drinks dedicated toilet access help yourself snacks helpful service from cabin crew we will not be looking to fly ba over virgin in future
114,missing baggage customer service was the worst ive ever experienced i arrived back in phoenix on sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on monday but it took three more days before they were finally delivered i understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in london my luggage did not make it onto my final flight i filled out the required form at the phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where i received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email but no email was received i made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and i should hear back within hours finally the email with the tracking number was received on tuesday night i went online with the tracking number on wednesday and it requested that i provide the same information that i had given them on the form at the airport my luggage was finally delivered on thursday afternoon
115,british airways are not the flag carrier they used to be the checkin staff at the club europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service the galleries south lounge was very busy but the food was very good there is a good array of salads pasta bread and hot food available the festive turkey and ham pie was particularly good the flight was delayed as lhr was very busy on a tuesday evening the boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate despite ba using a group system to board it took almost hr to board passengers the flight itself was good with a good club meal service the bar service was good but it seems that ba have done away with champagne onboard and also in the lounge a menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight the food was very good with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen ba have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed the seat is a standard economy seat with a table in the middle seat for club europe a standard practice for ba the seat was comfortable but with limited leg room the cabin was clean presentable and tidy with no issues the a featured wifi which contains a very good landing page with flight information access to the speedbird cafe menu access to bacom and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also overall the airline is still a good world player but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff the cabin manager was very good but the other crew in club did not display the expected behaviours in business class she kept touching her face not making eye contact with passengers and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there
116,stupidly tried ba again after a five year gap and paid over for my wife and i to go to barbados because i thought the new business class layout might rival virgin atlantic on the route about six months ago ba announced they were switching planes to the old antique pushmepullyou layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room eight seats across worn out fittings inedible food and surly fas
117,seat horribly narrow on a thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows cabin crew very good booked as a ba ticket that included travel on qatar airways as well
118,glasgow to london delayed by hour my wife and i now accept that a ba flight will be late and delayed very rarely on time as long as you accept this you wont be disappointed planning ahead theres a high risk of delays if you are connecting with another airline with oneworld its extremely risky
119,when i tried to check in online i was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under i decided to take it but then the website wouldnt allow me to choose seats or to check in i phoned ba and was happy that the call was picked up quickly but i was then told that because i had changed my booking i had to check in at the airport so we turned up three hours before the flight only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium the checkin agent was helpful but couldnt fix and suggested we try the ba desk airside that desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line we were told to try at the boarding gate at the gate we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window not sitting together after going through that the flight was surprisingly good with decent food and very good service we flew back economy which wasnt too bad either the flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic and emma and daniel who looked after us could not have been better ive obviously learned my lesson about late ba upgrades but everything else was good
120,i flew from prague to lhr excellent service attentive staff first drink service then meal service choice of three meals later second drink service in reality excellent flight couple of days later i flew back from lhr to prague boarding at lhr t was a total chaos onboard service cannot really be called service no curtain between business and economy class which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet meal service could not get more unprofessional rows took two guys nearly mins to serve constantly interrupted no people passing to the toilets at this time yet i dont know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you i was served that afternoon tea consisting of three canapeslike bites and some drink why would we bother serving you also a scone hardly after mins plates to be taken away when i asked for my scone it came as a surprise i was not served any no coordination between the crew crew busy chatting at the galley in reality the service could not get any worse one just must ask what do you pay the premium price for
121,disappointing again especially on business the service is ancient one world lounges are a catastrophe at heathrow business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard
122,during both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent meal we received a tiny bag of chips and a very small bottle of water what outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldnt even order any food drink because the card reader didnt function the first and last time well fly with ba
123,i was flying to warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to miami the next day initially my flight was delayed in denver by hours as such i knew i would miss my connection in warsaw the denver to heathrow flight was terrible the plane was dirty i was in economy i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability the plane was only about full and the service was not good my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ba flight to warsaw this plane was the smallest x plane i have seen packed in like sardines my bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to miami ba has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there i mean the bag is sitting in heathrow somewhere with different fight options to get it to warsaw yet ba in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day
124,booked a ba holiday to marrakech after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit i can now confirm that the points have been credited it took a while but ba did eventually make good on their promise thank you based on things now being resolved i have travelled on ba since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on nd january looking forward to the new ba concorde lounge keep it up ba loyalty is indeed a way street
125,extremely subpar service highlights no online meal selection staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed last meal was delayed to the last minutes of flight plates were literally grabbed away i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me no apology no offer of a napkin i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal because the seat before me was so tilted i could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off staff walked down with some water and biscuits this got exhausted just before she got to me she just looked at me and walked away nothing further was offered
126,i virtually gave up on british airways about three years ago writing off my avios and opting for other airlines but my return flights from heathrow to lisbon this week were very good the aircraft were pretty much full but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good a particular shoutout to a flight attendant called jo but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive im going to have to start spending those avios
127,i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service while the food was typical air plane food i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights
128,british airways is late their website is atrocious and they wouldnt let me checkin until hours before the flight i have been trying for hours to check in through their website andor find a real person to speak with customer service had such a thick accent i didnt think they were speaking english
129,flew from amman to london on nov not sure what type of aircraft it was my ticket was economy plus the flight is hm we received exactly ml of water and about potato chips the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system any other food or drink had to be purchased so we couldnt even get a warm cup of coffee or teas it is the third time i have flown with ba recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review will honestly never fly them again if i can help it
130,this is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline i flew with british airline on august st i had one checked bag that was lost at heathrow airport i am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected i filed a report for my missing bag on the same day i arrived at lax airport and that was on august st i waited patiently for three weeks which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation when i did not receive any update on my lost bag i filed a claim for compensation and that was on september th since then i have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue i emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today i contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting the only way to contact customer relations is via the website and theyre not even getting back to me every time i talk to a customer service agent they tell me to wait some more i have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet this whole experience was a hassle very unprofessional for a renowned airline like ba
131,flying lhr t to cpt november ba app and website not working properly would not load my ticket lhr t smooth and calm checking process quick but boarding card would not scan at security they gave me one for someone else to a different destination ran back to checkin to get correct one bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of t and retag them amazingly they did show up in cape town told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges turns out this was false information b pier lounge was open but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out arrived late to the gate train not working there was a biz class lane quick but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge not two seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink unbelievable that ba dispatches planes in this condition food average wine served way too late choice of wine with cold food or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later overall experience flew air france fortalaza to cdg to lhr two weeks earlier which was way better how embarrassing for ba
132,worst experience ever outbound flight was cancelled and i was not notified i was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip inbound flight delayed hour also not notified on top of it they boarded my hand luggage which was the only bag i had extra wait in milan then food is horrible
133,check in was a shambles at bwi just counters open for a very full flight the bag drop queue was even longer than the regular checkin queue boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well once on board the fas were fine not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible i was seated in an aisle seat row f where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom overall very cramped seat poor legroom and awful ife screens the meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time on lading we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t and since it was raining it was not a nice experience overall i rate this just as a mediocre journey
134,beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after weeks of emails and calls to ba two pieces reported th september ba responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service
135,on july th i had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that ba had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to italy and weve lost days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them for which i had provided all copy of receipts for i requested for my expenses to be reimbursed they agreed i sent all requested information and was told in weeks i will be receiving it its months later and british airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my followups on the matter
136,i booked the flight on oct but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i cant get my entry visa in time for the flight and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled but in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different one so i requested cancellation but ba canceled another persons flight and sent the confirmation to my email i assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than weeks i still have not received any refund so i reached out and it turned out my flight is still on and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba i tried multiple different ways phone calls and emails but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty based on my experience no ones reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in given all i have experienced i have zero faith in british airways
137,london to gibraltar on th october i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience ba attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ba aim to be positioned at of late the a has was no inflight entertainment or a route map the staff disappeared for most of the flight the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience
138,ive generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route im after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get we should have departed at but after continuous delays finally left hours late not ideal when youve then got an hr flight staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed they couldnt get it out and away quickly enough that was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service they were all extremely miserable and clearly didnt want to be on board were still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march this was cancelled at am for the pm flight 
139,a great flight the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british has returned to full service so meals were coursed menus and hot towels providedetc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals service was ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but thats my preference entertainment was good as was connectivity no real complaints except a minor one the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position i actually felt like i was in a true business class not by qatars standards but thats another story
140,i am happy to say that this flight was quite good except for the second rate euro business seating everything was very well done a friendly informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit well done unfortunately a bus gate was used upon arrival
141,just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable but times have changed these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all the terminal experience still feels classy and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient on board though its just become an experience to be endured bas mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane and nastier for the rest underlines this there is no entertainment no magazine refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day despite the competition being able to do this is it too much to ask for when trapped on board for five hours you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed on the return flight for one reason or another due to bas delays from the previous day we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldnt travel at all because there were not enough crew the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight altogether i would say good things if there were any but its hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for and that is a pity because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys
142,a very positive experience with ba seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep food was fine but not outstanding wifi good and video screen large and bright baggage came out very quickly at heathrow had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta all in all would fly ba again but would probably want to make sure it is new seats
143,baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all my second meal was something inedible no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts instead an assortment of dried something baggage took hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered a is a great aircraft but the ba seating is still the very tired old yinyang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of seats probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days
144,evening flight from lhr to iad on an a check in at t is poor most of their kiosks dont work well and staff have to be called boarding was very poorly managed the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft the flight was full and it left minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful they did their job very professionally and efficiently they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble they started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a hour flight the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight all in it was an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention
145,we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on th october there were a lot of americas heading back to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews the woman at the counter was rude i was actually embarrassed to be british at the time shouting snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her on the flight from london to san francisco prior to the hour check in i spent to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america once we boarded it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done but not only was she also rude but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for hours on a flight with a seat that wouldnt recline i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken attitude with british airways staff has been absolutely horrendous so after getting off the flight i decided to make a complaint to british airways bearing in mind that i had paid for the privilege of picking a seat i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the hour check in only to be told no they dont do refunds i paid for a product that was broken met with nothing but rude staff and they are telling me they cant refund the cost of booking the seat emails to the customer team and they are still refusing they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat all they have now offered me is a ba voucher which i declined on the basis that if they picked my seats for example i hadnt payed for the seats prior to the hour check in then a voucher would be ok but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken after all my experiences with ba i will not be using them again very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future im actually ashamed that ba treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain
146,while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating i got faint due to that heat but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response
147,lhrlax i prefer the boeing over the a as the seats dont seem too cramped checkin was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at heathrow t is a whole other story once through security its up the escalator up the stairs up the elevator down the escalator get to the gate no seating then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t before anyway cabin crew were pleasant drinks and meal service were fine it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight the entertainment system was good with decent options so i occupied my time with several movies nice landing at lax all in all ba was just fine
148,flew back to uk from miami in new club world suite a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world boarding easy took off hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces bedding and large pillow supplied attentive fas especially anna who addressed me by name however let down by very average catering not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife and sadly once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent inch touch screen refused to pay bas extortionate prepay to book your seat fees and still got seats together cmon ba do we not pay enough already to travel club class i can recommend bas new club class and we will travel this way if we can afford it in future
149,i flew with hand baggage but security at dubai was quick entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound flight on a left on time few technical issues with ife which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight decent snack and slept well arrivals lounge excellent would recommend
150,london to cairo first on this hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water even southwest is more generous when unable to connect my phone to order food i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour when the fa came to collect garbage i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter he used his phone to place the order
151,this review is specifically about maddie crew member who took care of us she was attentive warm friendly and nothing was too much trouble smiling from start to finish she should be the brand ambassador for ba
152, hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft no inflight entertainment in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase
153,dfwlhr had an easy transfer at dfw from american airlines to british airways heading to london first ride on an a left me with the feeling that this plane type wont ever be my first choice was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy but the seats and rows were very cramped when the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was inches from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen the seat itself wasnt too bad but i felt squished and locked in on a plus side having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night dinner was rubbish as was the morning prelanding snack the entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies tv music and games all in all it was an ok experience and did get me to london on time and our baggage arrived safely but im not sold on the a t at lhr is another story that will be in a different review what a mess that place is
154,check in at jersey straightforward there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at lhr captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off mins behind schedule with a minute late arrival at heathrow good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served disappointing that the wait for cases at heathrow t was as long as the flight
155,check in at lhr t was very quick and queue for security short we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time but was very busy and difficult for our group of to get seated together flight boarded on time whilst this is only a short flight mins the service of the cabin crew was outstanding glass of champagne coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter in spite of some of the issues with ba their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly
156,the checkin process was smooth i got access to the iga lounge which was nice but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge on board was what all this flight was about this was my first time flying intraeuropean business class and though i was well prepared i still found it underwhelming first the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off there is no personal ife so basically no entertainment for a hour flight meal service was very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin one of the choices ran out plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago i could see that staff did their best but since there were business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there was so much they could do also the passengers shared one single wc meaning a long line for the bath room something i have rarely seen in business class arrived at lhr we did not get a contact gate but the thing was that there was no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come it finally came of course and the delay was more on the airport than the airline but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t such things will affect their reputation
157,this is my first time flying bas new club suite which in my opinion is very good flight to the us including mine departed from concourse c of terminal which did not have many shopping or dining options however it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy the highlight is the club suite which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy meal service was slow and everything was served on one tray all at once i think now is the time for them to begin to get back to prepandemic standard at least the food tasted good which was not something i previously experienced on ba flights even in first class
158,my am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than h notice without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight upon calling customer service customer service who said she can only get me a flight days later they did not work with me as i miss days of conference they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden stockholm which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure i saw a direct flight to heathrow called customer service and was told there is seat available so i changed to am from gothenburg heathrow jersey however at this point ba told me i have to pay a fee of gbp as i changed my flight a nd time i find it a disgrace that ba charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference ba proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense i have since contacted ba for the legal compensation im entitled to according to uk law but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination if i have a choice i will never travel ba again such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs
159,i would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey i dont know how you manage to keep smiling couldnt fault anything helpful reassuring excellent food and i cant wait to fly again thank you and i really appreciated you
160,british airways personnel was just magnificent my flight into london was delayed security had long lines i ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there the lady at the gate worked the computer at miles an hour to allow me to board the software program was already closed this while the flight manager who came towards the gate urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line i was sweating from the run still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board i bolted again into the plane feeling bad that i did not personally thank her for her magic i really hope she gets recognized by british airways for her performance thank you for all you do 
161,good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart onj and lack of good leg room meal was good from singapore should be more snacks on board my neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didnt work
162,flight was hour late leaving gate crew were friendly seats comfortable but the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps
163,london to istanbul british airways business class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty front rows about are considered as business class with very short leg space no pillows no blanket horrible inflight service staff were harassing me no curtesy for business class checkin while waiting for flights
164,london to manchester british airways is probably the worst air company i have ever flown with they took hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour the staff were no help and frankly rude
165,flight was cancelled at the last minute due to weather despite pretty much all other flights not being affected booked onto a flight the next day arrived at the airport hours ahead t horrendous checkin and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight the flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done
166,after having a few not so good experiences in the past i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved first of all the improvement in the ba lounge in gatwick is massive the buffet was a joy we flew on a ba flight but operated by iberia express wonderful staff and the food was exceptional whoever brought in this change of food supplier congratulations also may i add that this time business class was not rows like last time but rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service i am still not clear on luggage being labelled priority the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports
167,this review is for ba booking system not a flight today i clicked wrong date on line my mistake and expect to pay a fee i then go to cancel booking and click on the option to not receive a voucher immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didnt want however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they cant tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they cant say when so they now have my money and i have to rebook at full cost in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up
168,manchester to seattle via london i will never fly ba again they cancelled my return flight from heathrow back to manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered we had to get our son come all the way to london to pick us up and take us to our car in manchester the food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night i will not be flying ba again
169,our flight in march from san francisco to london on th march was cancelled with hours notice we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport we had to stay overnight for the next day flight we still have not been recompensed for our expenses filled in on line and have received no replies on followups it is the usual min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up during this trip we had to reschedule a return flight my wife was ill this should not have been a problem as the flights were rebookable we were given a voucher this voucher was only bookable by phone when i phoned to rebook we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by phone you can see the problem how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings all i have been offered is another voucher the time to use has passed it must be great to be a business that can print endless a vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered we returned home with aer lingus with no drama
170,i sat in seat c our cabin crew lady was called gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy she greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing she had time for a quick chat and i think she said she was half german and half bulgarian a really lovely young lady who is a credit to british airways
171,full afternoon flight ready to fly on time arrived early uneventful flight good service pre dinner drinks drink with meal coffee drinks available at back avml meal was tasty hard working crew on a full flight audio worked well
172,i was told id require a hr negative covid test for entry into philippines booked my trip via bacom with a transfer in singapore they delay my transfer to the next day okay not too bothered as have my hr negative covid test but when i try to check in at changi airport the philippines airlines check in staff require a hr negative covid test had to rush to a different terminal get tested wait for the result rush back to check in the gate had closed had to book an extra night in singapore hotel book my own flight to manila then also the return journey back to london if one misses one leg of a ba booked flight the remaining flights get cancelled i discovered oman air business class and better then british airways from treating their customers quality of service the business class experience
173,having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed i boarded the plane on this basis i was subsequently dumped at barcelona airport at to sleep the night on the floor there was no help at there to find a hotel i have ms and cant walk without help ba did nothing their partners iberia did nothing at about am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches i lost my holiday my hotel booking and my music course ba insist its not their fault its the hotels for closing i would not have got on the plane had i known i found out i could go to arbitration ba now say they will withdraw the offer of expenses if i do their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger is bad enough for someone who is not mobile it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers so for people with disabilities its just not worth the risk of travelling with ba
174,i am a business class customer british airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with stops after i complained they changed the date when i told them the date would not work they attempted to charge me additional for the change i submitted a complaint and have not heard anything if you try to reach out no chance
175,barbara collins was super helpful my boyfriend i booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate slightly later one barbara was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together even managed to put us sitting together much appreciate ba we had a terrific flight over food drinks nibbles were great staff were so friendly looking forward to returning home with ba
176,my husband parents who are in their s and i were traveling back to ny from naples italy and had a stopover at heathrow london let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight back to ny the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult but she got it done she is so kind and is amazing at her job
177,on our recommendation my son and his young family child and baby months and wife flew ba to the usa from cape town leaving yesterday evening just got off the call with him after their arrival at heathrow shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided or not especially as my wife and i have used them many times a year for years of business flights from rsa this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday my grandson had a coughing fit so they asked bell push times for glass of water all ignored last one was told wait till drinks are served then when evening meal served no food available for the year old which was preordered online they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been preordered the cabin staff supervisors response prove it sir that sealed it for us if thats the ba response to whats seen as cattle class it will permeate to our normal travel class so our next booking will be an alternate
178,we had a nice flight pushedoff exactly on time cabin crew very efficient in all things friendly for the most part as well dinner hot and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good do avoid middle seats though even in premium economy only issue was with indifferentnonhelpful ba call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance nice start to a week trip to england
179,holidays ruined suitcases lost in flights i travelled from london heathrow to amsterdam with my brother before boarding we were told we couldnt take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin so they sent them to the cargo at our arrival in amsterdam one of the suitcases was missing left at london heathrow so we had to fill in a report in amsterdam this was days ago and we still dont have the suitcase or any information about it today i travelled from amsterdam to london city airport again they didnt allow me to board with my cabin suitcase and when i arrived in london the suitcase was missing left in amsterdam suitcases different flights theyve ruined my holidays no compensation no dates on when will i get my property back no information lies and more lies i was told i could complain online and buy all the things i need shoes toiletries clothes and i might receive the money back in days yes i might
180,despite bas promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website i have received no additional points and my four email communications including to the chief executive have remained unanswered do not be taken in by this marketing con they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises some things just do not change at ba
181,refund process is non responsive i have been following up on my refund since october which is months now i have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to email protected several times and all they tell me is its been processed british airways customer service is bad and needs to be worked on till today i have not received my refund i am just wondering what is happening
182,customer service is nonexistent for over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on bacom i was flying to nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly my sister and husband had tickets on the july from nairobi to jfk when ba received the death certificate they cancelled my sisters ticket not once but twice it took almost weeks to correct this incompetence my niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back the ticket was in premium economy when i tried to upgrade to be with my broken hearted sister the price was plus a service fee where is the efficiency where is the empathy where is the decency in addition to the stress of losing her husband my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until days before her flight also when i made my reservation i was given a price and within seconds was told there was a increase british airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion words simply dont convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company
183,flight on a sfo to lhr smooth check in at san francisco airport quiet and efficient dedicated ba lounge excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff lounge was very crowded though minor departure delay and onto a upper deck i prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter old style product but clean and well maintained staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals on time arrival baggage quite slow a good flight overall
184,for this hour min flight you are given a bag of potato chips and a bottle of water if you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone or like me you can preorder weeks before you fly however there is no guarantee you will get your order mine never came so after enquiring where the order was they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane that someone was me it turned out they also managed to lose my luggage i am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it i will never use them again
185,my wife and i booked a flight in april that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington when we checked in at edinburgh airport hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in online which we hadnt done we were instructed to come back in hrs and mins still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security to see if we could get on the flight via standby we waited and then finally at pm mins before our scheduled pm flight we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight mins after arrival time our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london we were told wed get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us when we got to security check area the line was massively long we questioned a ba staff member who said we had to get in line like the others we decided to pay pounds to go through fast track security to make our flight we got to the gate in time yet due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggagespace issues on the plane our flight arrived in london mns late and after going to the flight connections we were told mins before the scheduled departure with a vague explanation of there isnt enough time that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight we were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the checkin area to be rebooked for a later flight when we got to the checkin counter area a ba staff person standing at entrance to the checkin line advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in hrs when we finally got thru on the phone we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to get us on a flight days later and then not to our original destination iad but to baltimore i was not told or assured id be compensated for this extreme expense of staying more days in a hotel just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim online this ugly experience still ongoing has ruined our trip to the uk
186,decent flight and airplane non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight flight on th june from vancouver to london airport was delayed for roughly hours we received a cad voucher for some drinks this was appreciated because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to amsterdam from london within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the british airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards amsterdam when we left the airplane in london there where employees working and a people waiting line we asked around towards the nice employees british airways have and we have been told this was the only linedesks to get a reschedule for our flight to amsterdam so we had to wait and be patient after hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat at some point after hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldnt sleepstay at the airport as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight this flight was about to leave tuesday morning it was sunday pm when we arrived in london this meant we have to spent additional days in london before we were able to fly to the netherlands we have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the netherlands and save the receipts and we will get a refund on the costs hotel food transport and a refund on the flight for tuesday as we where not going to take this flight they released out baggage gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the tuesday flight they gave us we were going to make our own travel back to the netherlands seems british airways claims refund process is non responsive as we already requested information times for our compensation but received nothing yet apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight
187,reasonably smooth boarding meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley could they have offered to serve this afterwards seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldnt sleep even if the seats were comfortable this was so disrespectful and inconsiderate
188,three flights london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london generally the flights were of an acceptable standard though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a threehour flight the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit often missing on other airlines flights operated generally close to the advertised times but ba was let down by chaotic checkin and boarding procedures in preparation for each flight the number of checkin staff was one or at most two in frankfurt the lone checkin agent was also checking in business class passengers why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back this was standard across the three flights but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their enormous cabin baggage it would make much more sense to board people at the back first and to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last the small bottle of water and a halffull bag of crisps offered as a snack on a threehour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor
189,routine typical ba domestic shuttle flight nothing special departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a minute delay crew were attentive and charming usual clean cut ba product that when it works well is fine
190,over week ago i cancelled club europe flights due to testing positive for covid the day before they were booked many months ago and eligible for the travel voucher so i opted for this online since then absolute silence and ba pages state it might take up to a week previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation as a very loyal ba customer for more than years i am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays with a further bookings with ba planned for the rest of i have to admit that travelling with them ex lhr has now become an absolute nightmare
191,flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down luggage never made it to toronto and we filed a lost baggage report within hours our luggage arrived in toronto and a wonderful ba representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me would definitely give ba a star rating and have them again
192,check in and security at lhr efficient went to galleries north which was busy but fine with good service left from b gates efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus this was my first time on the club suite travelling with children ba moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in it was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy i liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product the entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned the menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable prior to covid one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back as it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but i doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out the club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly it was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it the second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which i thought was quite good on time arrival prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly we dont tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise overall a good flight
193,washington to london our flight was unexpectedly cancelled my husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight we were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip after spending thousands in lodging tickets tours etc when we finally rebooked we still lost one day one day of lodging and tickets to a show we tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us no one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money we are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here
194,nairobi to new york via london british airways has given me such grief trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking it is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight and i have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours i have spent on hold or with an agent being told that my query has been prioritized and that i will receive a call back within hours i call every days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation i will never book with ba again sure flying with them is easy but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time and to think i spent more money on a ticket with ba than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier big mistake
195,today my husband and a friend flew from dublin to london city airport all apparently went well from checkin through the flight after that the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom we waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage but neither my husbands nor mine came i found a ba service person to help me he told me that there were bags checked and on the plane i thought one of our bags made it then two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they too had not gotten their bags so i assumed the out of was some kind of interesting fiction i was then told to file a claim on bacom which we did at this time about hours after our flight landed the system says they have no idea where our bags are now ive had bags not get on flights before less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously i usually fly united airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info eg your bag was loaded onto the plane your bag is on its way to baggage claim ba doesnt seem to have anything like this in this case again it appears ba cannot even locate the bag i hadnt flown ba in many years and with experience i would never book them again
196,british airways is poorly staffed at venice airport no one to check in flights departing within minutes of each other hours before huge line snaking through airport flight crew fine london to baltimore segment on an older usually they are much nicer limited tv and movie selections wifi did not work flight crew ok food adequate
197,i booked a flight for myself and my wife from heathrow to nairobi in premium economy using frequent flyer points i then paid to reserve two seats on our own in a configuration cabin as i didnt want to sit in a row of people if possible a few weeks before our flight ba emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection when i logged in to see my new seat selection i had been moved into a row of the email also stated that if i wasnt happy with the new seat selection they had made for me i could get a full refund of the money i had paid i called to cancel the reservation which they did and i paid cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles when i asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable i read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable
198,departure was about minutes late the a we flew on was about eighteen months old the seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back it is a real challenge to get out of the seat the screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation i gave up trying to watch the cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service it felt very disorganised felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft felt unnatural the overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight i tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wifes meal but no one responds better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours i am going to explore other options before using ba again the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport
199,was going from belfast to london but they cancelled the flight and we didnt even know it was cancelled someone behind us had to tell us we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday the refund takes ages overall not happy at all
200,second time getting poor service from ba st unable to contact via phone email or website nd even with four business class tickets across the atlantic they do not allow free seat selection or check in until hours prior to the flight do they understand what the last hours of an international trip are like by the time we confirmed our seats my wife and our kids were spread throughout the plane of course noone at the airport could do anything
201,booked a flight from london to paris trip was cancelled due to covid lockdowns we asked ba staff for refund told cannot do but will issue vouchers we stated no good for two elderly people from australia as would not know when we can travel informed no other option and silly vouchers sent now they are running out of date and unusable have been asking for two years for refund many many emails they keep saying we took vouchers had no choice does anyone have any other options re complaints we would be most grateful really not fair to just take our money
202,we left mia late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane we arrived late and so missed our connection at lhr to cdg at lhr british airways rebooked us on not but flights to cdg and as such said i never took the flight to cdg and then cancelled my flight back to mia since i did not take my flight they did credit my avios for the one flight but said i never took it thus i had to book on another airline to return at the last moment trying to call ba was a nightmare on hold for over hour a total of extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle flight only problems feeding us back to the number we just called and were unable to be helped ba cost me overall we have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again they under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates dont be fooled
203,the flight was delayed over hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route finally i lost my luggage and no one has any information i will never again travel with british airways
204,terrible experience with british airways i was obligated to checkin my carryon suitcase due to my group number according to the girl at the front desk then they could miss my two suitcases plus the luggage of my boyfriend who traveled with me after days they delivered of our bags and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists now already days passed and still no information of where the last suitcase is always the promise that the bag will be delivered today but it never happens no respect with the customer first and last time with british airways for sure i dont recommend at all
205,ba cancelled my flight i never got on it couldnt book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees i was booked onto a flight with ba for april th from hong kong to london they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date covid ticketing flexibility assurances couldnt find a flight up to and including october so i opted for the refund thinking id get a full refund i was refunded about of what i paid i called their service centre for an explanation as i couldnt fathom how they could cancel the flight not have any other flights available and i didnt get a full refund each phone call takes about minutes before you get to talk to customer service and thats where the frustration begins the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case a month later and about phone calls later thats hours waiting on the phone they finally refunded me a little more in total less than of what i paid it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website just for an answer as to why i wasnt getting a full refund i didnt cancel my booking neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk after another month of waiting this is the reason they gave in an email thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation were sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on april your claims been refused because ba was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason further to your request i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund as the same is looked after by our support team we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule thanks again for following this up with us please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon best regards british airways customer relations i dont know what non payable commercial reason is i am out about sterling going to just leave it their and boycott this company
206,belfast to london on jun i was informed at about flight ba has been delayed to will only reach london heathrow at i reached the airport at but ba counter was only open at at checkin counter i approached ba ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at on the same day the reply was it is the customers responsibility to contact the airline theres nothing we can do i was given a card with contact info on ba customer service and sales for the next hrs in the airport i have been trying to contact ba but was told that hotline only operates from i have to called another number for urgent cases which ever number i dial i just couldnt get to speak to any one till again i was told that theres nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines onboard the aircraft when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment i was told that its the customers responsibility to do it on their own i would think twice to take ba in the future
207,the customer service of british airways is really bad you cant reach any call centre agent even after waiting for mins now i really appreciate emirates and turkish airlines after facing bas low quality customer service not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul ldnjnb is really low quality other airline operators which are working with doco for flight catering are way better than ba i guess ba has selected the lowest budget option from doco overall my rating is for ba you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them note respect to their cabin crew
208,ba is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers seat does not recline legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can good old times of being a glamour flying ba has far gone ground force almost reduced to only a very cheap pack of crispy and water the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy or well pretending at least for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative you pay extra for absolutely nothing
209,this a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade plus helpful and friendly fa minuses the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space it was hard to adjust the seat particularly getting it to lie flat even the fa found it difficult the inflight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films tv programmes and music the food choice and quality was poor one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible the cheese selection was also poor i dont know what the business class offerings from bas rivals flying similar routes are like but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia
210,as a regular ba customer on european flights it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate flight boarded at for a departure mins later late customers were allowed to board and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew the benefit of low cost airlines is they they dont hang around for latecomers sadly ba is in a time warp over this ba pilots used to be some of the best for updating status but this has dropped dramatically in the last years the food standards and choices in the t first lounge are one of the items that have been improved post covid inflight service on this short h m flight was a light dinner tray only choices by row with passengers in club europe only salad options were available no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given menus for customers it appears there is no supply control in place at ba food quality was okay but while doco supply this the doco meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ba manages i flew turkish days ago staff service was perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin i end where i started ba standards continue to slip
211,right now do not use british airways when booking person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination but he was wrong flight to london was late we auto missed our flight to edinburgh and had to wait hours for the next flight coming back once again flight leaving was late had to run to get connecting flight then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so i thought good that is probably my luggage once back in boston luggage did not show up they said we would get it within hours and we didnt so far it will be at least days
212,i could very much understand losing my luggage for days with how airports are doing this was a risk i was well aware about when travelling to greece for my wedding however in my many attempts to receive communication from this company it has been nothing but disappointment and upset the company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband the most recent time i have called them is because i requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bags location the man on the phone verbatim stated and if i dont after this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in edmonton with westjet and that this was not his problem before saying hold and not taking me off hold i did not book with westjetnor is this westjets luggage issue they have been amazing when i have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone i will never use this company again nor will anyone that i am close to this has been completely disheartening please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication i have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before
213,the a is a wonderful aircraft quieter than any other aircraft ive flown flight was delayed arriving at vancouver from london which meant that departing flight from vancouver was also delayed passengers waited almost minutes at london terminal for baggage to arrive excuse given by ba ground staff was that the baggage staff are very busy right now and our baggage will arrive soon onboard amenities and services quite disappointing seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when i last flown with ba a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight no offer of water juice or other beverages during the flight overall a fairly disappointing experience with ba
214,lhr to sfo in new club suite rather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengers pushback delayed by lack of tug club suite seats kk a huge improvement over previous cw product with excellent ife and a good range of movies cabin crew attentive and efficient food adequate and still served on the same tray arrival more or less on time but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge long queue to get through immigration
215,covid form is broken called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone hour flight delay was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when i entered the plane i explained that i really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as i have hours drive left after i arrive at the airport in short totally not customer friendly will try to avoid flying next time with ba
216,feels like ba are putting the economy back in premium economy very pleasant friendly and helpful cabin crew however it was over two hours before food was served on this alreadydelayed pm flight a single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service and with the food you were offered wine only but the crew could come back later if you wanted something else including water i drank wine anyway but i wouldnt leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food ive never experienced this on other airlines premium economy products i flew westjet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded then brought them to you before and then with your meal in glassware brilliant air new zealand do glass and use your name throughout water eventually came round after wed eaten as i say the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed underequipped understaffed or following poor procedures food was forgettable inflight entertainment was great and the screens large unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens brightness levels reset to their retinasearing default not fun on a night flight with turbulence loos on this gatwick were halfway down economy which was pandemonium or at the very back the upside to this layout is that pe is next to the exit so we deplaned very quickly checkin queue at cancun took forever couldnt see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate grateful for priority boarding in this situation bags arrived ok at gatwick no delay i continue to avoid ba unless using avios for business class or where there is no alternative bas problems all seem so easy to fix their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you why arent they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point
217,phoenix to london heathrow and then to hamburg despite a hour layover in heathrow bags didnt make it onto the connecting flight once in hamburg there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a deadend no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee a group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible checkin desk other baggage tracing desks calling emails for two hours to no avail the solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description four days later no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service absolutely miserable customer support our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly ba again
218,worst airline experience ever flew people business class check in was a disaster the claimed i had exchanged tickets after hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes we were group but the delay caused us to board much later the connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with children including an infant the ultimate connecting flight was also hours late then they lost our luggage days later they still dont have our luggage calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a minute to hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone this airline is a complete disaster please do not fly them
219,the crew ba on june absolutely made this flight smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew ive ever had rebooking for september we were that impressed
220,i travelled on the th april with my baby in economy class flight ba and ba i had the pleasure of meeting sarah air stewardess she was absolutely amazing i received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond it was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated she repeatedly asked if i needed anything as i had arham in my lap most of the time she held him whilst i had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft we had a chat and the service was just amazing it is something i will never forget thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight i have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated hope you see this
221,outstanding inflight service from the crew friendly professional and helpful the very best of british even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at vancouver it didnt matter the crew made the flight outstanding
222,recent trip to boston departing lhr t ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirements in the us they were really friendly and personable very short queues for bag drop and security i would say it took us minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within minutes seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density layout in economy compared to the abreast seating myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the ife box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other the cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and proactively offered drinks outside of meal service meal service was very efficient with cabin crew proactively removing trays from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy the food by doco was exceptional i dont think ive eaten so much on a transatlantic flight in economy it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an outstation overall it was a great flight helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere i would definitely consider flying with them again
223,my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively the flight was very expensive though as we booked late after being dumped by air canada swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment
224,as a seasoned traveller and a loyal ba customer i am appalled at the companys recent drop in standards we were booked to fly from zhrlhr on a miles ticket in february when we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage we have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed as this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation i tried contact ba customer services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didnt bothered to respond at the rd attempt after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that i incurred as a result of their mistake
225,boarding on time but unfortunately from orts worst boarding gate which obviously was beyond bas control crew were good but lacked the personal touch old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space and the was showing its age however we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites the cabin crew were good food ok wines a little disappointing overall a decent flight
226,flight delays can happen but the way ba handles such incidents in just way beyond our flight was delayed overnight our connecting flight was missed the overall delay resulted in more than hours rechecking our bags took hours standing in line a rebooking to an earlier connection was denied be it online or at the counter will certainly never fly ba again and do not recommend this airline
227,check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar and finding the flight was delayed by nearly hours no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier easy boarding in sequence numbers seat is a joke for hour flight no leg room on isle seat of the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat only choice cocacola water or red wine the connecting flight from lhr man was cancelled with no contact from the airline i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs with no alternative flight provided we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for persons as this worked out cheaper than the train the outbound flight was also a farce no mention of terminal change at lhr from to so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us overall shocking from british airways and can guarantee i will never use them again
228,british airways travel with confidence probably the most unsuitable tag line they should be ashamed back in october i booked a holiday to punta cana with ba only to have it cancelled early in late last year i also booked heathrow to malaga for a family wedding in may guess what a few weeks ago that also got cancelled i had the chance to rebook with ba but with so many cancellations planned i was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event so applied for and received a refund i have now also asked for my executive club account to be closed as i shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline my suggestion is if you want to travel with confidence choose another airline any airline
229,business class seating shown as a x configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat not much more comfortable than economy meal service started with three options but was down to options by row out of in business class and by row where we were seated only one of us had options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class
230,we arrived and half hours before our flight the queues to ba was terrible the airport security lines were not managed well the gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate with asthma it was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced all the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least hours before to have an enjoyable experience amsterdam is the worst airport i have experienced
231,ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within hrs that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative hours after booking i need to change my flight i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will that was apparently a lie they actually give me a voucher to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week i am panicked so i try calling them of course calling them does nothing the hotline says that they are too busy this happens again and again so i give up submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing luckily it shows up quickly and i rebook then i need to change my booking again i go to request a voucher again this time the voucher code doesnt work on the website when i enter it so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher finally i call the executive class phone line which i am not a member of and then eventually pick up and agree to help me they do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in hours
232,i have been battling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in the flight was cancelled a voucher was issued another flight was booked using this voucher and then again cancelled after trying to use the voucher for a new flight ba kept advising i couldnt as the voucher had been used i asked them to check the status of that flight as it never left and the agent advised she didnt have access to that information two years in i managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record i then decided to pursue a refund as felt this would be less problematic ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund one phone call they said it will be with me in working days i then chased when it was long overdue i was then told it will be with me in working days the refund never came i try regularly to get through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agents are available i have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me requesting an update but with no response honestly feel very let down by ba who up until this i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now
233,when i tried to check in they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel but i did not have it i tried for over hours to get it issued but my bank where i had the travel insurance the department that could issue the certificate was closed it was after a very long time i got a cover letter which the bank sent to me but then to be told i had missed the check in by minutes they would not let me board and i missed the flight so i contacted ba and tried to rebook another departure flight only to be told that because i missed my departing flight my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was ba policy so then they worked out a new price to book the flights but now the price was i originally paid for the flights i then did a search on google and found flights for flying out with air mauritius and returning with ba on the same flight i was originally supposed to return on unfortunately ba had made me miss days of my holiday i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ba site that i needed the insurance document when i checked in for the mauritius airways flight they did not ask for the insurance document and i had a lovely flight with no issues every time i fly with ba i have a bad experience and i promise i will never fly with them again
234,another dreadful mediocre experience with ba to malaga this time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no aircon then on flight the the wifi was erratic and guests couldnt order food or drinks then the card payment system didnt work so we gave up on ordering finally at malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case we caused the plane to go unbalanced really its all one excuse after another with ba these days
235,basel to johannesburg via london cancelled connection flight confusing ui still shows cancelled booking in my bookings never sent a confirmation email for new flights cant checkin could checkin online or via the app customer service is nonexistent busy line after min still no one there to help me check in
236,very low standards for club europe there was no cabin divider in the aircraft so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected aircraft not properly cleaned in athens there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket no inflight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from european routes which is a shame staff was attentive though and tried their best
237,this flight was not affected by recent problems with ba and i was quite impressed by the british airways premium economy product in a new boeing overall premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class also the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing than in the old b or even than in the b seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room food service and entertainment options were good clearly worth the extra money for premium economy
238,british airways continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers the most recent experience has cost me more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company even as part of the executive club silver i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over hours on the phone seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust
239,on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight back to lax i saw the come out of my account the next day as im adding in my booking the day before my flight the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to someone else i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them on twitter i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding they just left my message unread after about hours of waiting for a twitter dm back i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british airways app and was unable to find it i would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once i refreshed the page but it did not i continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time say it was a success then never add the booking im not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again im extremely frustrated
240,amazing flight and comfortable the premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest new aircraft staff very friendly and professional the food was great beyond expectation
241,i booked a flight to london and paid months in advance to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row front of the cabin more legroom upon checkin my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else and i was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet i spent an entire afternoon calling customer service if my call went through at all the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy i was placed on indefinite hold replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered i was greeted by someone with a heavy accent over a very low quality hard to hear line i am and not deaf sometimes they would purposely hang up before i said anything other times they would purposely hang up after i stated my plight if i managed to persist through all of that for hours on end they would hang up purposely after needing to put me on hold once more to speak with their supervisor in the end ba managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars and i booked with another airline on principle
242,we are on our way home after a week holiday in the uk and have had all flights with british airways our internal flights between london and edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications however the long haul flights have been a nightmare our initial flight from cape town to heathrow was a full flight the staff seemed very overwhelmed they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the leftovers my entertainment system was also not working we are about to board the return flight from heathrow to cape town and the check in process was horrific i had booked through expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which i didnt realise until we checked in i ended up having to pay an additional for my bag after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and i also spent minutes on hold trying to get through to the ba customer service number with no luck we asked to speak to someone is person in terminal and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main ba terminal overall it took us about hours to get me checked in after speaking to about different staff members none of which could help me there was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend i am traveling with was allowed kg and after paying to add my bag i was told it was overweight as i was only allowed kg and the bag was kg compared to having flown with other airlines i will never fly with ba again the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect
243,i would like to thank you for the great service i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying alone and had a layover in london of a few hours i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight
244,i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service british airways short haul business class was in a totally different class the cabin had rows of seats in bc a record for me the staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent the food was first class nothing was too much for the staff why oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company british airways keep up the good work it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your european competitors overall you made me feel proud to be a brit
245,we flew from dubrovnik to heathrow on the th april check in was very fast and we cleared security in about minute we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious when boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services choice of main meal options which was very good served by very friendly crew the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at heathrow slightly early overall a very pleasant trip we will be flying again with british airways
246,i have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service delays dirty aircraft over packed lounges cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline having paid almost k extra to change our return flight for the family to get a flight at a specific time ba cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost hours later there was no option to get any of the other available flights the business class lounge at lhr was packed with hardly any space to move the aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor the seats were uncomfortable food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket the poor level of hygiene overcrowding delays cancellations makes this the worst airline i have had to endure
247,business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of british airways but as it had been closed since january the least british airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport i complained about this to ba and as compensation they said they would credit my account with avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account i have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department when the phone was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling this scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers
248,our good friday flight was delayed by hours std atd to durban south africa from johannesburg there were no announcements made when approached no time frame was given they simply didnt know an aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at johannesburg crew arrived late the aircraft was filthy we shall never fly comair again that includes kulula or ba absolutely shocking service
249,we had a trip with flights included all flights were delayed the worst with hmin also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a h earlier flight loosing h of our short vacation no explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays i expected a lot better as i have earlier used ba with good results this was a really bad experience and i will avoid using ba for any further travels
250,my first time in the new club world suite excellent lots of space and privacy very good seat i doubt if this can be bettered good staff as ever my only quibble is that the food is all served at once ba needs to roll this out quickly
251,i had an incredible rude check in staff at the british airways counter in nice on th april zero empathy towards me a struggling customer second situation happened when we arrived into nice terminal on ba april where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery when our luggage arrived at nice airport the day after and received an email from the avia partner lost and found british airways partner at pm informing us that our luggage has now arrived in nice after multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that i did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had short days in monaco it was vital we received the luggage asap the lady replied if it is so important why dont you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning this has been an appalling experience
252,we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london as qantas fly to heathrow british airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ba from heathrow to glasgow we booked this flight in october however days before we were due to leave we received an email from british airways advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled to help us out the email said they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport which is miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh not glasgow not sure how we were supposed to get from glasgow additionally it is in economy not business class even though we had booked business class originally we booked this as one connecting flight so british airways know that we have just travelled hours from australia there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for british airways they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number their office was closed i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly british airways again
253,the service was very good the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size the seat was comfortable for economy and because the a walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor there was a lot of space the food was good for airplane food the only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasnt good quality however there was a large selection of movies and tv shows
254,total chaos for departures immigration at malaga airport boarding was quick polite welcome by cabin crew beverage cart after take off was prompt followed by lunch with a choice of entrees food can best be described as wholesome but not meeting quality levels of air france swiss or lufthansa short haul business class meals menu is still missing and like many other aspects of the experience ba cut a lot during covid and have not reintroduced i wouldnt mind but on european trips in ba are charging up to times the fare levels of and the overall value for money is now very poor the wifi did not work from start to finish of the flight crew said it had worked on the way out and the captain had contacted london to get it fixed on the return ba is becoming more and more shambolic blaming far too much on covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings
255,shout out to the help desk at heathrow we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady with years exp was great she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay food to eat and a flight home the next day
256,i am constantly amazed how british airways continue to get things wrong i pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last years living in the uk i have watched their decline with great sadness my flight to paris was no exception not only was the flight late overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff that we sat on the tarmac full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on front and then back left me gobsmacked as they barely offer any food service anyway small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water on a minute flight i wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to paris as it transpired i was over minutes late and missed the meeting i was flying to paris to attend never again
257,the short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago most business class offer across but this layout still squeezes in across as we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the points game but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats the points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us this status would have allowed us to book the seats days prior to departure when they were still available rather than the hours when they were not available on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she would check nothing happened but after takeoff a passenger was moved from economy to that seat judging by the interaction between them i would bet it was someone on staff travel i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this takeoff was just after hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it in summary would i ever fly with ba again no not if i had half a chance of going with another airline
258,a very comfortable new suite flight with great service and good food crew was wonderful new seat is great except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable entertainment great wifi was annoying cutting off and needing constant reconnecting generally a positive experience
259,british airways is the most terrible airline ive dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we cant make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers you cant check in online the application sucks so much youre better off trying to code your own app and itll probably work better every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we cant verify your documents yet the app and website say youre verified and ready to go you upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says its guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online wont work they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return i hope i never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with british airways ever again
260,british airways is the most terrible airline ive ever dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we cant make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers i have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip wed booked with our year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in japan as ba just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers
261,ba is getting a real bashing on this forum and i thought id buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba this monday easy check in decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers very clean plane which left on time ridiculous amount of legroom in d it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than a or c reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived mins earlier than scheduled whats not to like which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experiences over the last years anyway i thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once
262,new club suites are amazing the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow i have ever used food was ok as i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok the cabin crew were brilliant but i was surprised that after dinner the crew didnt once come round with beverages or even bottled water ba really have a great hard product here and i would suspect the soft product will improve once covid restrictions become less of an issue well done ba
263,very small plane for a busy route service was good but food not so ran out of a lot and options left were not good cabin crew for ba actually really friendly
264,ba continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service provided by people who shouldnt be in customer service on tired dirty and cramped aircraft out of flights this year not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations ontime including having business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered still no refunds months on and had a flight late and missed connection so ba cancelled the rest of my ticket leaving me stranded in the us
265,flew back on ba bridgetown to heathrow in the old club class a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites the end of this awful yin and yang seating cant come soon enough even tried to pay bas extortionate prebooking rate for our seats none left to choose even weeks ahead my wife and i were stuck in the middle seats of e and f good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often the march film selection so not good not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though bas policy has changed regarding flying back to a nonmask wearing destination ie london sort it out ba took off minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight dinner not to bad but breakfast fairly dire my wifes smoked salmon bagel was dreadful as usual when ba is good its really good but when its bad its awful i recommend hesitatingly come on ba be great again we pay a lot for premium seats
266,the worst budget airline ive ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though theyre basically free ba charge about x as much as other budgets but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed they left us sat on the plane for over hours because they couldnt connect to the internet then left of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyones flights if they waited another mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive it took three days to return it and cost us s then on return ive now been sat here nearly two hours and theres no sign of our luggage again i dont know how a company can be this incompetent but ill be pursuing for compensation i have some free flights from amex but i wont be using them because its not worth going through this again
267,first the actual flights are fine and the staff on all flights zrhlhr gvalhr lhrzrh first in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrhlhr impossible to checkin online and just staff to checkin everyone for flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gvalhr hrs late as noone at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhrzrh mins late due to slow gate staff even when you checkin online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass there are more examples and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard getting to be onboard 
268,have not flown economy with ba for years what a shock hard uncomfortable seats small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment food and service appalling hr plus flight no socks eye shades ear plug amenity pack and no antibacterial wipes offered wifi advertised but not available on flight paid premium money for a budget airline more akin to easy jet ryanair or jetstar my last time travelling with ba after more than years of flying with them ba you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be
269,flew to barbados march on ba in the new club class suite a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way back comfortable big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphones plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private nice friendly fas called by my name from the off and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served once again let down by a poor at best choice of movies on the inflight entertainment system thank goodness the latest james bond movie was showing took off and landed on time smooth flight only one letdown the usual extortionate fee charged for prebooking a seat come on ba stop nickel and diming it spoils what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege i recommend with the usual caveats
270,very poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this was no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming in the event take off was permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drinks and nuts were served circa minutes after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese two small pieces were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine was offered we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight was some hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice was available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort flatbed as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below of the price paid for the premium cabin time was when flying in business class was real treat no longer is this the case
271,our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland barely edible and by far the worst weve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals no snacks were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airways again
272,complete and utter chaos at heathrow yet again surely the ceo sean doyle must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed the queue for the first wing check in at am today was over hour and subsequent flight to malaga hrs late leaving the gate updated about the delays times but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry ba seems to think this is normal practice nowadays as emerald oneworld i wish there was an alternative because ba has become intolerable and this is after flying them for years since beaboac days
273,feb we show up at the airport hours early for our flight to dublin we waited in line for hours to just check in our luggage after that we learn our flight is delayed another hours we had a connecting flight in london when trying to go through customs they wouldnt let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in minutes they told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour we then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from london to dublin was delayed over an hour however by the time we were told this information the doors were about to close the next available flight to dublin was late evening with that being said we were forced to stay the night in london after talking to a british airways manager they informed us that ba would reimburse us for any hotel flight to get to dublin regardless of the airline clothes due to them losing our bags excursions and transportation due to this issue we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes lost out on days we had booked to explore the country had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received went days with lost bags when we finally got home we submitted our claims like we were told to do within a few days its declined we have asked for a contact just to talk to somebody again declined we tried to reach out via social media and we get passiveaggressive messages they refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to dublin transportation to and from the airport in london the hotel for london the clothes i had to buy because they lost my bags for days and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes i had to buy there is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from
274,british airways are in the process of upgrading all its fleet to the new club suite but ba had the yrsold packedlikesardines club world product the lounge at cpt was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived on boarding we were surprised to find that the menu amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer we suspect this is another cynical timesaving initiative on the part of ba frustratingly the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline the drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy its hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth apart from a rather turbulent ride the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule baggage handling was however atrociously slow
275,we flew to funchal madeira yesterday madeira has no covid restrictions for entry yet ba asked us to upload our nhs vaccination passes before we could check in online i received an ok about an hour later but my husband did not so i couldnt check in online we arrive at heathrow hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in there were just desks open for a queue of approx travellers then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open with the queue barely moving i went to complain to various ba staff who said the manager had been told and more people were coming one blonde lady walked around for ages shepherding travellers into the queue before sitting down at a desk another man later did likewise making us wonder why they hadnt simply worked at the desks from the beginning all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour before almost running to the security queue which thankfully moved quickly then we hurriedly bought a sandwich walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane the whole experience was extremely stressful and took the best part of hours we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane and completely unnecessary if we had been able to check in online this would not have happened my husbands vaccination pass is fine but not required for madeira i think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order as did i even though id previously been told i could check in online also unnecessary as if ba had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved a staff member told us ba had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return but having been treated badly they didnt want to the flight itself was fine on time we were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water again fine nothing praise worthy
276,absolutely bad experience with british airways i have two bookings with them for the past two years both were cancelled the first one i understand covid unexpected but today i got another surprise my flight to antalya in may was cancelled and no explanation is given i will definitely not book ever again with them
277,flew ba lhraus on a on the outbound leg and then back on the a on the return leg seats comfortable staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing safety briefing was missed on lhraus route lhraus boarding on time flight flew out on time landed on time auslhr boarding one hour late left an hour late and landed one hour late too food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs in flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad screens not working on return leg worked fine but this is due to the a being brand new good quality of sleep on both legs which was good check in at lhr was flawless and without incident check in at aus was rotten we queued and were number in line and waited for hour for staff to check us in what was clear is staff quality in austin is poor passengers did not appear to have passenger locator forms ready verifly app ready and or vaccine detail ready having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it baggage was received fine at aus and lhr the latter took ages on return if i had the option of another airline i would not fly ba
278,the food was awful an over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing terrible then went to a traditional breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash browns such rubbish on ba
279,i really cant believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore was closed so theyre using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in suffice to say it was not pleasant onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slippers the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having passengers to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean its first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu most of the food was awful my steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canap of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing was the constant galley noise there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat k which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so were in and out of that as well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally im happy in club and would never do first again
280,london to dubai family of kids where from down to years old savvy travelers been on many holidays so we were excited to be on ba for first time but disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since dublin that morning at am we had no time to eat at lhr so thought well get something usually around hour into the flight hours after take off they served out food food was fine but nothing special no issues with beverage no attention to kids as youd expect from many other airlines even a kids book would be good movies are all outdated and already watched so overall very medium experience
281,one would think that the number of crises ba incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art i last flew with ba may yes the weekend of the last but one it crisis i swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket aug to bologna ba cancelled the flight then covid hit so ended up with a voucher fast forward to feb th received a message am mins from lhr that that my flight was cancelled arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers the staff that were there either told you to go online a bit difficult as the ba systems were down or ring ba ha ha or go home not very helpful if you live two hours from lhr by some miracle the app sprung into life and i managed to get one of the last seats on the evening flight sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop soon ran out of seats by midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds pointed out ba should have provided refreshments told to put a claim in eventually got to departures and made it through security ba customer services note the oxymoron had a consistent queue of about people as ba were still cancellingrearranging flights for passengers who were airside boarded flight mins late sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to reconcile luggage when we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a fivehour flight they purport to be a topclass airline but in fact ryanair has more finesse the staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation well so are the passengers the aircraft are cramped and worn i had been reluctant to use egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a ba ticket how on earth can ba justify their prices the management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline
282,we will never use ba again for a long haul flight our experience of the flight from lhrmle wasnt too bad apart from a screaming child but the return wasnt a good experience we werent provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight i think the crew in premium economy were very young and not very experienced leaving the experienced ones in businessfirst actually i think ba only care about the businessfirst customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes they ran out of food choice rows back in our cabin its not a large cabin ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for hrs apart from a couple of biscuits one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen we werent fed until hrs before we landed it was a hr flight and then it was a soggy roll containing slices or cucumber and slices of tomato ba just dont care anymore about the little people
283,british airways is getting worse an worse my flight was mins late luggage is taking hours to arrive no communication whatsoever from anyone they cant be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails if they do my app is crashing most of the times they change the aircraft without notice so even if you pay for a seat the staff will say there is nothing they can do
284,paid for business class seats to london from new york got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class couldnt even provide compensation or a refund told i had to call customer service or submit a form unbelievable unacceptable never again
285,absolutely shambolic customer service the lounges at heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible waited over an hour for my chosen fooddrink order to be brought to me ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so on board product is average
286,our flight back to athens on a different airline was very delayed causing us to miss our first flight home i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline whats worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with and i will never be flying with them again
287,flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable the aircraft was better than the outbound flight who screen was so small after serving only about rd of the cabin no first choice only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin the airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal so why include it as a choice also to offer a roll of hamcheese for breakfast after a hour flight is cost saving a hot breakfast should be offered with only minutes between my connecting flight due to late arrival i made staff aware whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight it was a struggle to get my connecting flight on arriving in glasgow got txt to say my bags did not make the flight first time using ba premium and likely my last
288,there was a mistake on my booking made by ba got an email to say contact us to discuss took over contact attempts spanning hours and still not resolved absolutely the most shambolic customer support i have ever experienced still waiting for the call back i was promised weeks ago
289,the economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight with only about passengers but business class was threequarters full boarding was therefore mercifully quick and takeoff on schedule sadly ba makes use of the old club world product which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba there are some good points about the old club world the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat but other than those its an embarrassment the tiny poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current overly cautious postcovid requirements with everything served at the same time this does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily but its a lacklustre experience in contrast to bas competitors and smacks of continued costcutting queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean arrival was on schedule but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage
290,british airways continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience was like economy from years ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full x seats because of it issue the day before even if werent the seat pitch and width is the same as economy gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food was dreadful the in flight service was unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they dont any more other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around years ago how i used to look forward to it the small gestures like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful
291,outstanding from the warm smiling welcome on board this flight was excellent the in flight crew were friendly attentive and very professional detailed announcements from the flight deck as well food and wine all very good indeed the premium economy product on ba is also very good comfortable seats foot and leg rests and decent recline fr superior to any other airline on other atlantic routes
292,british airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights although they pretend publicly that the policy remains ba from london to malaga on th february and across visible rows around me there were out of passengers wearing face masks and i was one of them this was long after the meal drinks service had been cleared and remained like that as we landed and deplaned cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell i guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules
293,for once more ba got it all wrong with hours delay food voucher of pounds and no information or advice no staff to serve the waiting passengers the attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity
294,another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service the day after storm eunice and english half term holidays are getting underway so you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays the fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and european destinations on the evening of saturday february for operational reasons was pitiful you could not rebook via bas website instead passengers were compelled to queue at gate a at lhr to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight some ba cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the south lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at a were a disgrace
295,check in at iad was quick and easy lounge in washington was a ba lounge and very good sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight flight on time and boarded promptly as we had eaten we opted to sleep there was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it we slept well on time arrival and quickly made it to t arrivals lounge which was excellent
296,very old planes poor food and minimal leg room in economy check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored i spoke to a ba customer service representative as soon as i landed in heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on twitter telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable
297,having just booked ba for a return flight being one hour each way in club class and paying euro for persons to be then asked to pay a further euro to choose seats in business a full business class ticket and a fee for seat a very disengaged management model
298,ba got everything right allowed evening before check in this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the us on the day of travel it was half term and the airport busy in spite of this through security and into lounge in minutes lounge clean staff proactive and food served quickly good range of drinks easy transfer to c gates aircraft ready boarding quick and well organised pre departure drinks served the cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service the food was the new club world menu options roast beef which was excellent although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained on time arrival baggage off very fast overall an excellent flight and it feels like ba are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use covid as an excuse for service cut backs well done
299,appalling customer service they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking hours and hours on the telephone with no response or you just get a recorded message to say they cant take the call they dont respond to emails sent to the complaints line
300,this past novemberdecember i flew washingtonlondon return and on the strength of that trip my first in two years the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the prepandemic status quo ante the cabin was clean and well maintained seats were comfortable food and drinks were good including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg and the ba cabin crews remain the best in the business this was one of a number of bookings that i had to rebook a number of times due to flight cancellations and contrary to the experience of many here my rebookings were handled courteously and thoroughly although i did have a number of lengthy waits on hold but under the present circumstances thats to be expected its good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time and im looking forward to future trips on ba
301,i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline our initial flight to dubai was canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute i found that booking with them was extremely simple unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure i called the customer service waited about minutes before i could speak with someone and within minutes the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund the person on the line was extremely nice understanding and willing to help us i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline i got the full refund on my credit card the day after i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on ill definitely make sure to check with british airways first
302,ba cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later we had no issue with this just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible however they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from lhr and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at atl the aircraft was newish and in excellent condition flight was around capacity service was excellent staff were friendly and efficient dinner was good breakfast was disappointing with little choice the lhr to bhd leg was equally good and i am beginning to think that ba are getting their mojo back again
303,boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack aircon at the gate the club suite cabins were about full but the rest of the plane cant have been much more than occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after takeoff which is a real bonus on a nighttime flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive the new seats dont significantly aid sleeping particularly as theres an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons overall a good flight
304,unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane the good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible the bad was the inflight entertainment the screens were unwatchable when they worked my wifes didnt and post ipad era just dont live up the food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff im afraid ba has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels
305,utterly appalling company weve flown with them two times now and both times its been a disaster the first time return flight was delayed by over hours there was nobody at the gate to tell us this so a large group of passengers had to roam round dubai airport looking for ba staff there were none eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs where a very angry person told us it was our fault and we should have been given a letter we had no letter they then put us on a bus to the other terminal when we arrived there was nobody to greet us we were literally just left there we had to yet again contact another airline who managed to find us transport to the hotel when we got there we were told it was full and we couldnt choose our rooms we were given a terrible dirty cramped room several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved eventually we got to board the next day my tray table was broken as was the window blind and i didnt get a meal no compensation was offered the second time i need to reschedule my flight the website assured me this was fine but provided no link i needed to phone up if you need to phone ba dont even bother trying i never got to speak to anyone and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling the food has been terrible meagre portions given infrequently my sandwich was inedible
306,over the past years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a hour flight home to newcastle while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless first time in february i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke they had to staff ran a kiosk queue of over unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop in the end after a hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone in november i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight my layover was now hours and all i got from the guest services was a food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for minutes found out it was not from complaints considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for seemed really cheap a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working when i got a response i said i wanted back off my holiday i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing
307,return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december was good in all respects whereas the return trip was disappointing check in was fine apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority resulting in a long wait for our third bag the lounge was busy but no complaints we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there was no sign of activity although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from to and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durban and flown to cape town port elizabeth back to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late boarding eventually started at with departure at minutes late drinks service only started minutes later followed by lunch the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standards with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service was quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew
308,i used british airways for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service firstly i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage my flight was however due to unforeseen circumstances i arrived at the airport around i was convinced that i was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long i stood there a few minutes but then realized that i would miss my flight i went to club checkin and the lady was incredibly kind to me i just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though i was at fault she weighed my luggage and i was able to board the flight successfully i was not aware that this airline gives out free meals we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair even though they have excellent service as well in the near future unfortunately diversity the first time i flew was in and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british airways it was different the staff was very kind and friendly as well what a wonderful experience to fly with these guys
309,i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked so i come back to the question can big corporations lie with no accountability why would i spend my hardearned money on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers stop your lying or update your promises
310,i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as ive witnessed the airline decline into a subpar service i understand that its been a tough two years for airlines but bas decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted enormous queues at jfk ba checkin terminal even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining theyd miss their flights terrible efficiency at the checkin counters at times only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phones or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in the interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasnt pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like im clinging on to my airline status which doesnt actually provide you a better service these days
311,the entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didnt work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline
312,straightforward and friendly baggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our bags on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after minutes and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after minutes of looking around menu was basic with no eggs hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins ordered a frittata as was so hungry made my way to the selfserve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and shouldve gone to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the doors cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didnt with no apologies or even trying portions were small plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished chocolates are lindor nothing special about the other amenities toilets were no different to what youd expect amenity kit was basic duvet seemed well used it was not worth almost times the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claims of world class standards
313,on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the checkin desks luggage drop and checkin was appalling it took us over hours to get our bags checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one checkin desk for euro traveller club europe one for bag drop and one for the checkin flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport
314,in glasgow one check in desk open huge queue with no business check in it took me close to an hour to bagdrop getting onto the aircraft in glasgow no hello from the crew and the same getting off i normally find ba cabin crew very nice breakfast was a very tired looking croissant i used the ba lounge in terminal not very keen on the new table service poor choice and miniscule portions lounge staff were very nice in both directions on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t to t we were packed in like sardines so much for social distancing the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another hrs mins captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers no drinks or anything offered while we waited food was not even worth mentioning as far as club europe goes its not worth the extra cost no priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ba and he was right for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time ive never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable on board i gave the food a miss heathrow back to glasgow flight left on time food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined both cases were last off again club europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin i would have thought that ba would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is
315,after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats k and k to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yinyang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isnt dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be back
316,i paid for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me id be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods phone website twitter and finally email they told me id be getting back which is less than half of the i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded i emailed again and they told me id be getting more back when i emailed again saying that that doesnt add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with thats the final amount turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of and i was only getting total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and theyve yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me
317,very nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups this is super comfortable as passengers dont jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the hour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing i think it is great that they also have food alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes domestic t arrivals is a breeze
318,overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around c and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a hour hop much better than those at air france and together with an enhanced legroom in row it was wonderful for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of wellpresented however simpler meals on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdglhr leg air france presented a chic cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawback was the first wing experience at t the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead its quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was one way return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the money
319,first of this was one of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling the entertainment system is basic it does not support bluetooth headphones the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless the crew were nice so sorry i missed that
320,flying during covid is always a challenge bas verifly app worked perfectly and online checkin was seamless the bags drop at t was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones although an older it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drinks before lunch was served with more drinks with the meal the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it was only economy but after hours flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed
321,flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge was good food and drink choices very good first cabin on is seats comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top banana food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba
322,i had low expectations of business class ba on european routes but this flight was even worse t is a mess with minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round boarding was chaos and we left an hour late a was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat there is no inflight screen no overhead screen although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ba the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen headphones good food and drinks arabic coffee dates and gracious service ba hang your head in shame
323,weve just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better inflight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared the wines were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet heathrow was a nightmare as often happens being minutes early was rewarded with a minute wait for a gate then a hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid times
324,my flight yesterday was due to take off at soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for preboarding then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app we then had to join a line for the customer service desk it took two hours to reach the desk in my case on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to get my bags back i was told to cancel my booking on the ba app they could not do it at the desk i was then directed via a gate to collect my bags this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a baggage belt then i waited for my bags for hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day
325,it is first time we have flown ba business class in a aircraft and hopefully it will be the last firstly the checkin and crew were great friendly and helpful it was manual checkin not a machine which is always much nicer no complaints at all in that department food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter or desert and choices for main course business class seating is with alternate seats facing backwards as are both the centre seats we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passengers it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glasses within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a bag so everything has to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first rows of centre seats so not much storage space we were in row and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case but normally if as a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partners legs not some stranger i am ft and could just about manage my wife at ft could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ba in future if at all possible
326,i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august they took almost months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons i have sent them a complaint per email and i still didnt get a reply it has been months and i am still waiting for an answer furthermore many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves what a business class customer service
327,british airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all
328,i have a flight booked for january they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight was changed my second flight was moved to the next day making my layover hours called them was told to just cancel what kind of answer is that i mean i still need to fly to where i am going and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive it is a very big inconvenience for me and i dont even get an apology just cancel
329,i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home id been under the impression that it was a simple process just call up and book onto the same route that id previously paid for and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves but on a new date how wrong i was first i had to pay to top up my flight a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the flight as well as them still keeping the airlines id redeemed they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and thats just how the system works however if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fees they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did so i cut my losses and booked the flight or at least i thought i did the call centre agent who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision and no way to escalate issues took my card details including full card number dates and cvc code and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow a week later i still had no ticket no details no charge to my card no booking reference nothing i called up to confirm the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details once again i waited another week and sign of being booked onto a flight thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to british airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight spanning over weeks on the friday before my monday flight i sat in tears to another ba call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag the next day around hours before i was due to fly i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag luckily i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online the whole experience was stressful costly and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to british airways hold music furthermore there has been a significant cutback to bas inflight catering service due to covid resulting in smaller portions leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight though ive flown ba repeatedly with few problems in the past their service has gone significantly downhill
330,extremely disappointed in trip experience i am gold mvp miler with alaska airlines my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airlines when speaking with alaska representative they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on british airways in accomplishing this task i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process i departed egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska as flt was changed to a hour later flight with a completely different airline delta who does that without notifying the customer i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle they said my ticket was not valid i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue was they explained british airways had rebooked with delta this took about mins with customer service then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out i am so frustrated
331,british airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the am flight from t at heathrow to paris cdg on nd november which was boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about cms a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about customers on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight was okay this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid safety protocols in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flights their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk
332,i was refused an early check in and was told to come back at pm for a pm departure there was no staff until and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger
333,check in was ok all documents were scanned without problems the flight was delayed by minutes due to crew members been stuck on the m not the airlines fault replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new a neo went ahead the club europe cabin was rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off for me at tall i can fit ok however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room the inflight service was a a stop start affair nothing to write home about the crew failed to work as a team you had to go to the galley to get extra drinks i was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal not bas finest hour
334,arrived at the south airport in tenerife hours before departure iberia had not opened the check in even with a full flight waiting the usual check in process post covid took place with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food boarding was done by a meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate not sure why the plane was a very new a neo with rows of club seating the seat was ok for a hour flight but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inchs between my knee and the seat in front food and drink where very good served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers good selection of wine to go with a above average salad overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew
335,checkin very slow no app checkin and could not check my vaccine qr code online check in staff friendly but too few of them ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge to use boarding fine but plane was worn out seats close together and row even worse crew really professional and happy it seemed arrival at heathrow a total shambles ba landed at no gate so waited and waited for minutes then ba jetty didnt work then ba had no steps very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch so ba skimping on lounge plane condition and gate crew good seats very uncomfortable
336,after h queuing at the checkin desk i am told that my booked seat is not available why do you sell seats that you do not have
337,outbound seated in row i was told they had run out of my chosen food option shepherds pie so i had to settle for gnocchi the steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier as if ba could not get a better one on the return boarding from the back not by priority then seated in row i had the last half glass of champagne only because one of the other passengers in row had declined food was rigatoni with vegetables overall penny pinching by ba in club class dreadful not for us again
338,flew club europe london tenerife south november and returned november club europe seats are not comfortable you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of empty to spread out a tiny bit for the fare i would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room it would make a huge difference we did at least get a meal outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash which were not too bad and a drinks service however on the inbound ba had no white wine apparently there is a problem with their suppliers did not prebook seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes back to the flights both in a new or nearly near a both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect not a good check in experience at tenerife south just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue also not a great lounge the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two i would only just about recommend there are still reservations about exactly what ba is trying to become
339, hours standing in line for boarding pass airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight and yes we used verifly my flight is now delayed for at least minutes they are so unorganized and slow getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines you have to wait even though i paid for it avoid this airline at all costs absolute worst
340,i have been trying to get a hold of ba to change my return flight for the past week now i cant change online because im flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online ive tried live chat several times and waited hours only to be told theres no one available during business hours i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end customer service is non existent however of course if you call the new booking line someone immediately picks up of course however they cant help me nor put me through to anyone apparently shambolic excuse of an airline that doesnt deserve to be a national airline i havent had these problems at all and ive been flying throughout covid for work unfortunately its been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i dont even speak spanish
341,this whole experience was sickening over grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about would not even allow me to add tier points the flight to london was marred with problems in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield the resort riu paradise beach was riddled with bad food drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ba staff to sound off too the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month now we all know this is a better option
342,poorly mismanaged services this time disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around hours just to check in then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for mins finally when we thought things are better now on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned around passengers including me had to wait from am until am for the next flight on boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba
343,currently dreading my flight with ba considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called live chat all we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me we just wanted to be able to make a name change absolutely impossible their website is unusable their customer service is a shambles they couldnt change the name told me that we shouldve done the booking more carefully well youre going to have these people making mistakes so maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights like hello its the st century you should have a button saying change name anyways not the point the woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasnt making it clear on what to do then when i gave up towards the end of the call i just said thanks for your help ill deal with it la got cut off minutes and got nothing all i can say is good luck
344,another ba shuttle flight and a good one fantastic flying weather and i would say a load factor good professional crew friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries and getting to the a gates at t makes for an easy exit still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery
345,flight from larnaca to lhr check in was ok the lounge was an aspire lounge and shared it was basic but ok flight left minutes late but made up time en route there were rows to the business class cabin on this a service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered its a long sector and the food wasnt great drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware not really interested if im being honest when weve paid a lot of money for it staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be club europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer the seats are not so comfortable not dreadful but something for ba to think about
346,upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day test and the check in agent denied us boarding causing my wife who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the uk much distress he was only doing his job of course but we requested him to call a supervisor the check in manager goncalo ribeiro came to our rescue not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day test uploading it onto our plfs verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through checkin he was at the gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey we could not have asked for better service he was a very professional ambassador for ba
347,club europe on british airways outstanding and wonderful to have ba back the welcome on board was warm and sincere flight attendants helpful friendly and professional great updates from the flight deck super lunch and good choice of wines ba at its best hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz
348,good flight but boarding was chaos was gifted with the beautiful a gate at lhr t so we were bussed to the plane first time ive used a bus gate there the a was at t at a gate with a jetway nevertheless passengers full flight boarded via steps this caused an hour waiting at the gate as well as the baggage taking ages also the seat recline on ggatl f is broken
349,usual ba economy trip pleasant crew complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft very cramped seating and uncomfortable the armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward i have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and its not for me other than that ba still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced this time it was good value
350,check in was easy security quick lounge fine lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed which was great flight was fine my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree there was nothing bad about food but nothing great either drinks were fine and proactively served on arrival efficient pcr testing where it was needed and fast turnaround baggage off quick
351,what has happened to british airways the whole preflight experience now is prehistoric they appear to have gone back to the s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue on the premise its due to covid precautions they are the only airline making passengers do this and they cant even open all the desks so for passengers they had two check in staff like the post office in apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where theyre just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace ive chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me k of spending to earn so that tells you how much ive supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years in the last year ive booked ba flights personal and business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries of the have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for weeks that cost me my holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they wont extend the voucher im even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline im not even going to bother using my second voucher and ive cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed whod have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option
352,i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it was an absolute delight on both inward and outward journeys i was impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who was absolute joy and a credit to british airways i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much
353,the plane was clean and air quality very good timing was perfect i was seated in k to begin with i had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat when i requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started i was told that tea would be served after dinner i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened at dinner there was no tea service i did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea there was no hand soap in the washroom however on my way to london from toronto my experience was a good one however it was not the same on my return flight
354,the service was excellent the cabin staff were attentive and efficient the food and drinks were very good the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice overall a very enjoyable flight
355,i booked and paid for what i thought was a business class seat on a flight to athens what i got was a premium economy seat the first nine rows were business class seats rows to were what should have been the premium economy cabin but had been added to the business class section which had less comfortable seats that didnt fully recline unlike the seats in rows to i was in row this is not a case of me being snobby but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba misselling had i known prior that i would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight i wouldnt have booked i complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way i also made a formal complaint to ba but was fobbed off apparently this is a long running scam i dont know how they get away with it
356,terrible customer service booked my flight before covid couldnt go still cant go as borders are still closed i wasnt given an option just told i have to take a voucher now i have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although i booked for a flight for cayman and i still havent been able to go they cannot provide the service i paid for and refuse to refund me they are not sympathetic or understanding the voucher is valid for another two years i wonder how many flights will go up by then i wonder how many more regulations there will be ive been such a good customer and feel i deserve better
357,this was my first flight during the pandemic so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines checkin was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc but on the return flight it was a total mess just two counters open for economy and one for business there were arguments regarding vaccine checks where two ba staff were contradicting each other it took an hour and ten minutes just to check in resulting in the flight delay on board i was not expecting great service seating was extremely uncomfortable inch pitch and inch wide seats just about bearable for an hour and a half flight on board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another no eye contact with me just handed out however i was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate the cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers
358,lca to lhr in club europe quick checkin at lca with speedy passport control and security aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink boarding by group and pushback on time ce stretched back a full rows and the single toilet struggled drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore onboard wfi was adequate if rather slow and it shouldnt be charged for in business class arrival ahead of schedule disembarking en masse and through egates surprisingly quickly overall a flight that was typical of the postcovid standard for shorthaul business class
359,i had booked a flight from heathrow on friday th august to fly to manchester airport on arrival at heathrow to check in the british airways staff informed me that i had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake i offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sisters name but british airways refused us to board and sent us home however the staff member who i spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which i would get shortly so that i could fly at another time with ba since they do not offer refunds i never received these flight vouchers i have chased numerous times on the phone with ba staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me they have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers they say i was just a no show which is inaccurate i have sent numerous emails to ba explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers i have had no response to my emailsmessages one ba staff member on the phone said that i should track down the lady i spoke to at heathrow and ask her if she remembers me so ludicrous as i did not take her name and i doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of ba customers a day
360,we have flown with ba for many years and never will again where there is an alternative booked and paid for club class flights didnt receive a meal or drinks onboard crew were so unorganised we were delayed on the ground for minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the inflight service was delayed once up in the air they commenced the service albeit very slowly then abandoned it and closed the service altogether the crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual we fell short of our standards generic speech but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service
361,the crew at denver airport is top notch so impressed with their customer service they were very patient and courteous thank you all for being amazing
362,an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the govuk website or risk prosecution some people challenged this statement and were rebuked ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice some people were anxious departing the aircraft other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch sky cafe still not on sale not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england
363,ive had to book six flights with ba recently all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though wed scheduled around hours between flights ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part they couldnt get us to our destination within hours of our scheduled arrival time we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far perhaps ba have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment its an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment
364,the service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy the flight down from london i was in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i cant give you the bottle only a glass however the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run out the crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair we got diverted as volcano ash was impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria mins from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga we got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach i have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and breakfast
365,such terrible service in club world such indifference and lackadaisical attitude hardly any service everything has to be asked for and gotten asked for a cup of tea and had the flight saywhaa and then when i said cup of tea she said yesasked if wanted milk and sugar brought to me lukewarm tea with sugar sachets no spoon or stirrer pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full mins before someone came by eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea seriously bawhat are you doing is this how you welcome back people to fly
366,lhr to lca galleries lounge chockablock first thing on a wednesday morning and t seemed as bustling as prepandemic boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away expanded club europe stretching back rows the new norm departure on time good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch postcovid lunch remains restricted doco must be horrified by what theyre having to produce miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish ive ever tasted wifi access wasnt free for business class passengers for an hour of intermittent service is excessive arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at lca
367,very pleasant flight to lisbon it was a full flight and we left about min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft however in the air great service by the male crew on a big club class cabin friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers late breakfastbrunch served was tasty what a contrast to the iberia crew lisbonmadridlondon who were cold and unprofessional
368,no check in staff for economy never experienced this before while business passengers strolled up economy passengers were left standing for mins plus
369,no refund for flights cancelled months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until april tickets bought on edreams on june for a flight on july from geneva to so paulo through london british airways round trip the lhrgru flight was cancelled without any explanation i contacted both edreams and ba a number of times in the last months but they did not refund the euros that i paid
370,stranded in the lounge because i wasnt allocated a seat this for a flight that i booked months ago i didnt want to use them but was forced to because emirates wasnt available i advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options
371,i think british airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid travel flexibility really means because it doesnt pass the commonsense test i purchased a roundtrip business class ticket from new york toandfrom mykonos through london i traveled there with no problem the day before my return to new york though i took my covid test and learned that i tested positive i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website the recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply says therefore we cant answer your call try again no ability to leave a callback number or a voicemail etc for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a thirdparty agent i did not i bought it on bacom and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site i called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the london athens or new york lines two days later after having negative pcr tests the most accurate test i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new return flight to the us ive now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day never to get through finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was misbooked they have offered that if i send them a greek doctors note saying that i was sick then theyll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation
372,my flight from boston to heathrow arrived in time but i and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane we were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay because of this delay i and other passengers lost the connecting flight to tirana i was offered another connecting flight which was hours later from the time of arrival when i booked this flight one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour turning it into an hour layover i think is unacceptable and very poor customer service it shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for i am very disappointed by this experience
373,year after year the british airways ba service on the same route washingtonlondon is becoming worse we just had one bad experience after another on this route in july british airways ba notified us that our connection flight to nice was bumped from pm to pm so we had to spend an extra hours in the airport during this covid era their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check ukgov for the covid rules and regulations for transit through london which said that no covid test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a covid test to show negative results they charged us per person for a rapid covid test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary we could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight food service was horrible they served food with lots of cheese to me while i had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies ba damaged our samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online we have been trying to resolve this issue since july and after asking us for photos like times they are still giving us the run around
374,ba used to be my go to carrier and i am a silver member however their service seems to have gone hugely downhill flights get cancelled the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app invariably this is not possible you cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for plus minutes to speak to someone if they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly i was stunned by the recent cancellation to my catania flight two weeks before i was due to travel
375,the entertainment system was working badly the screen was freezing every time i wanted to open flight map though the aircraft was years only the window blinds worked with delays the crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a shorthaul flight after flying with aeroflot and s airlines i expected to receive an excellent ba service but i got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water i think its unacceptable for a nonlowcost carrier to offer service like this i can get that hot meals on board are now rare i loved the most comfortable seats in my life i tend to have problems with sleeping on board but this time i didnt even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff
376,i flew on british airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to kg each the value for money here is incredible the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water there was wifi onboard which we paid for the full flight access package and it was great it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands
377,very efficient evening bag drop security quick galleries north lounge was very good food and drinks fine plane left on time pre ordered door was ok early arrival fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early
378,me and my year months baby girl flew business class from moscow domodedovo to london heathrow on august when we landed at heathrow my baby was sleeping i asked stewards for my stroller and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building i grabbed my sleeping baby who is nearly kg and luggage bag another kg and walked away i went and entered the building and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor and there was no one to ask just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me on top of that we landed at terminal and i had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder i met no one whom i can ask for a help first british airways representative i met was after passport control i explained the situation and he said that i have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases no further assistance or help i had to wait another hour for luggage and pram i am absolutely frustrated upset and disappointed i can see that british airways do not care about mothers with kids at all
379,for this flight from heathrow t passengers were piled into the bus and left for mins at the terminal very unhappy passengers and when confronted the ba transport managers response was sorry we are still learning on arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage i helped shame since lounge service was very good for the flight out from munich ba had not re signed up to the now open lounge in munich to me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event
380,ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your checkin this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff dont seem to want this they want to see the actual forms tests etc this wasted about minutes and is pointless the return flight again had no access to the club lounge you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again last flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience on board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to ryanair on board food was very good for a short haul flight
381,they cancelled a flight i booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof british airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher
382,ive been flying with ba for years and never had any issues i recently had to arrange to have surgery in budapest and naturally wanted to fly ba so i booked my flights from bhd to bud via lhr online on their site once booked i informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment the very next day i received an email from ba telling me they had cancelled my flight to bud but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier a much earlier flight the same day only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from bhd arrived i would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue but seemingly not interlude to get into hungary during covid one needs a valid reason with medical treatment being one i had to fill in a very confusing form on the hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of hungarian and pidgin english anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted so i took the earlier flight but this meant i had to fly into london the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel so operation booked hotel booked airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked what could go wrong around three weeks before i was due to travel ba rather unsportingly decided to cancel my flight to bud again needless to say i was furious i complained to ba customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel great excuse only having looked at bud arrivals info ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months so bas covid excuse rang somewhat hollow epilogue i got refunded most of my money from the flights i booked with ba although they refused to refund my bhd lhr flights because who knows i also lost the money i had spent on a hotel and half of the money i had spent on booking airport transfers given the cavalier attitude ba seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that i lost a not inconsiderable sum of money ive decided to avoid ba from now on
383,check in well organised no lounge in cancun efficient boarding process given water bottle before take off no welcome drink now covid rules are being relaxed this needs to change menu good and food acceptable staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience managed to sleep a few hours for the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly this may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into gatwick at that time
384,departure lgw north so aspire lounge bag from fine lounge basic on time departure cabin crew welcoming but only given menu water and amenity pack looks like some of white company bedding options removed lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service not complete return to old days but getting there flight generally good early touch down club world luggage off last which meant a wait of minutes for luggage
385,booked flight six months before travel then month before the flight ba cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day bearing in mind that people have work and school that wasnt ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks we rebooked the flight as suggested by them and a week later ba cancelled the rebooked flight we were told that we will receive a refund within working days over two weeks passed and i called again i was informed that they cant give a time frame for processing refunds and no refund issued yet ba representative refuses to give contact details to the manager they cut the phone
386,the airline cancelled my initial return flight with a hours layover in london and my only option was to book the next flight that has a hours layover thats before i board the flight to toronto while i understand schedule changes and do my best to stay positive and supportive i contacted the airline asking for upgrades to a best seat i asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport they denied my ask no explanations and no empathy not only that but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation again not the change in schedule not the extra hours layover time just the way they chose to treat a customer who didnt do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute
387,i was traveling with my wife in business class from seattle to bangalore via connecting flight in london and we reserved our seats together while booking the tickets but mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass they assigned h and d called several times but they couldnt do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available when we boarded the whole plane was empty and still they didnt allow us to seat together
388,i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges but this flight was my only option note that ba actually charges for seat preselection in biz class uk pounds in this case does any other airline in the world dare do that i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free the seats were bas universally derided cramped across backtofront configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arms length away no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement i wonder why no preflight drink was offered at meal time i selected one of the three main offerings only to be told it wasnt available even though there were only people in my seat biz section the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position the bed is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class and is also very hard the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm the amenity kit is the smallest ive ever seen in biz class it fits in the palm of the hand all in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the that ba charges for this route i used miles to pay for my ticket but of course got whacked with bas unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of for using miles
389,aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and checkin and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient although admittedly its only having to cope with a low passenger load at present it was good to see that checkin carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms thanks to just passengers on board with more than half in club europe the flight took off ahead of time service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class with too much prepackaging the covid effect presumably arrival into t was also comfortably ahead of schedule and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control we were through the egates and collecting our luggage just minutes after landing
390,i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze after frustratingly missing my flight due to m road closures she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges i am really grateful
391,after sixteen months of being grounded by covid it felt almost surreal to be back in t heading for what to us was essential summer sun in greece t was blissfully quiet with no queues at checkin or security and even the galleries south lounge was less frenetic than usual despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape boris johnsons bully boy attitude ordering food and beverages from ones table seems something worth continuing avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets the flights was very quiet with just pax on board of whom were in club europe boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous groups service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual doco quality landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form overall a thoroughly reassuring coming out of covid experience
392,ba cancelled flight in dec refund was promised in voucher form by call center we are now months down the line calls of which each is min waiting time and email reminders conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher head of call center is keeping to her empty promises
393,fantastic flight down to heathrow crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water its a start
394,boarding and disembarking were greatly organised passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows from the backside to the front business minimizing the possiblity for jamming same at disembarking passengers were asked to remain seated then row per row was called crew members were supporting the process what could be improved distribute handsanitizer during boarding when snack was distributed my row business was overlooked for some reason after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food staff was surprised and fixed it this was my first flight since one year and i appreciated the covid measures taken by ba still it left some strange experience
395,this was not my best experience with ba thus far as there were a couple of disappointments i was happy with the fast baggage checkin this was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline the covid protocols are not as robust as they should be particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance there was a big mix up which i find inexcusable i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but i dont expect such at this level bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome the plane arrived minutes late
396,ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flight after having my return cancelled times i opted for a voucher so i could rebook a new route i had not been informed before requesting the evoucher and i would need to call up to rebook im in a different country and the phone tariffs are extortion so not only was my flight cancelled times i wasnt offered an option to rebook a new flight online i was inconvenienced every step of the way
397,absolutely appalling experience british airways unfortunately has lowered its standards and to my dismay ive been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than ba customer service representatives are completely clueless unprofessional and not bothered i recently had my flight cancelled on occasions and the staff werent interested in helping me return home
398,had booked the above mentioned flight but the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates the airline didnt notify me until i learned that i could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when i went for checkin it was a single ticket with the company and they said they didnt realise i was flying from canada to india via london the restrictions didnt allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones when i booked a single ticket from canada to india how come they didnt realise i couldnt fly no refund at all gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years but i dont have any travel plans for the next two years that means my money is gone when talking to representatives they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was onetravel the worst experience ever with an airline am a frequent flyer was trying ba for the first time but now i guess i am never going to fly with you on my return journey the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didnt allow them to take me a poor show with ba
399,my return flight from antigua to london was cancelled times when i call to ba several times their computer system didnt work and they couldnt issue new ticket as the result i had to pay airport price for baggage as i couldnt pay online without ticket they promised to give me compensation of hotel stay food and travel if complete online form when i done it i was asked to submit expenses but link provided was to lost baggage expenses not what i claimed i replied that link is wrong and asked for correct link they replied that they wouldnt compensate anything
400, cancellations for month applying vouchers only to find out they dont work after new cancellation terrible stammers do not recommend to anyone in covid restrictions
401,i had travelled to india for an eye surgery on my flight back to london heathrow i was assisted by a member of the cabin crew madeline thomas she was an amazing person as she made sure i was feeling okay as i had come back from my surgery and was traveling by myself she was more then a nurse and took care of my needs like a mom she also made sure i had eaten my food and stood by next to me as i was feeling awful because i was in lot of pain
402,i was travelling back from mexico city on a business trip fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment which the staff do an admirable job with but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of ba first at the moment firstly no lounge at all at mexico city terminal theres a paid lounge but the check in staff wouldnt help with the details mexico city terminal has functional lounges for aeromexico working not good enough for an expensive ticket finally got to board and the staff are incredible but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come the food was literally inedible in first and staff offered commented as much every time so for an hour trip in first the option really was chocolate or crisps the first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention the seat would not easily convert to a bed it had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby again not what youd expect from a premium product i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch was never found ba has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers given that i told them specifically where id left the watch i can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it all in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service ba isnt offering it at the moment if it is essential that you have to fly really dont bother with first unless you have to or go to another airline the company just dont care
403,charge fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance absolutely disgraceful their site says fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount i received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative
404,good service the whole way nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight plane was clean and refreshments were provided my only issue is that the flight was packed understandable as it was just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the masks my return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either just hoping for a little more personal space next time also wifi did not work i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic im sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant value for money marked down only because the christmas flights were so expensive to be expected though i know
405,i entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that i should have felt obliged to bring the flowers when she realized that i was going to my mothers funeral with the flowers she was apologetic she had no idea why i was bringing in flowers but the crew were very nice to me during this flight
406,i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldnt get home ive also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british airways starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding im not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba checkin but unfortunately couldnt do it as my results didnt go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive ive come to her times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady ive ever met unfortunately i didnt catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i cant thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did lastly the nice lady shame i dont know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i havent met them i dont know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no one in
407,dubai to london on th december flight was ok seat comfortable enough crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all when coming back to heathrow many seemed to have below their nose announcement made at the beginning about masks crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end when leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing on way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged a guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight he had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything not like the crew were busy either did services the whole flight then rest of the time didnt see them of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks enforced by the airlines
408,this is my first flight since january we have had three cancellations which ba handled superbly but this flight went ahead check in at lhr was fine no fast track se unity at t galleries south lounge open they have an app system it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly followed this with a shower they are openlimited hours flight on time and well presented a staff worked hard nice drinks run the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times landed on time priority baggage cane off late overall happy with product and would use again
409,i had a direct flight from london to lahore and travelling with them was a nightmare they did not have milk for my sons bottle didnt even give warm water for his formula milk no kids meals no snacks meal portion size was tiny glass of juice you literally have to beg them for drinks water etc staff was so rude and treated us like trash if you compare them with emirates i would give emirates and british airways its not at all child friendly i will never travel with them again
410,overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines i had to call ba a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and i would rate their customer service everyone i talked to was extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines i was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge they have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in the flight itself was fine and i appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea the one thing which i mean as constructive criticism though i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports the arrival sheets for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in italy when i asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in venice thats fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for days on the day i travelled overall my experience with ba was very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service i received
411,i am extremely pleased with british airways as they refunded my tickets munichlondon citymunich within working days in a friendly and professional manner the difference between british airways and lufthansa is night and day friendly professional and prompt are adjectives to describe ba while lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant impossible to contact and ignorant well done and best wishes to all at british airways
412,boarding and checkin formalities are very nice check in help desk was very helpful and supportive everything was nice except food i am vegan and there was no food availability for vegetarian passengers if not preordered my flight was hour journey from london to bangalore and i was hungry
413,i have always had great flights with british airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing as this was my th flight i decided to celebrate it in club europe which turned out to be a perfect decision the stewards working in club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight other features didnt let me down either efficient business class check in at warsaw cosy executive lounge preludium with attentive and helpful staff well organised boarding although no priority for club europe because of corona the aircraft was very fresh and clean seats were comfortable with enough legroom adjustable headrests and power ports the on board service is different than before corona times but its still very good tasty lunch box from doco with fresh chicken sandwich oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse the choice of drinks was wide including a very good quality champagne from nicolas feuillatte all in all a perfect flight experience with british airways everything i expected from this flight was fulfilled the one thing i can complain about is baggage handling at heathrow we waited around mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of club europe priority
414,we had a flight to santorini from lhr at am as the flight was full we had to check in all our luggage we arrived at the airport at am and the queue for checkin was incredibly long because some desks were closed it took us over minutes to arrive to a desk and when we arrived we were told that the checkin had closed at am and that we had missed the flight british airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime the lady at the desk booked us on a flight to athens instead telling us that the costs to reach santorini would be reimbursed we had to book two tickets worth for a flight to santorini on the same day we have just received a response from the customer relations service telling us that we would get nothing
415,my flight from los angeles to paris via london was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so i missed my connexion in london and arrived in paris late and missed my onward connexion on air france and had to overnight on my own dime in paris i applied for compensation lawfully due me through ec but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in london under the hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly paris and their cr agent acknowledged this after i pointed out the error she ignored me so i filed a claim with the centre for effective dispute resolution and ba sent them a defences they claim i traveled on af and arrived in london ahead of schedule the truth is that ba at lax rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however af refused to accept me and my baggage unless i paid them a surcharge so ba then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into paris and misconnect and have to overnight there i do not know which is more shocking that ba would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name records air history
416,i was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight the plane to london was or more full and no social distancing could be applied a number of people wearing face masks incorrectly over mouth or as a chinstrap throughout the flight and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack small bag of crisps and ml of water it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever also only the absolute minimum of service which given covid is understandable but makes the flight really boring or not since some excitement was provided by turbulence with very little information from the flight deck disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but terminal was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance an upgrade for euros one was was available but it didnt seem to make sense at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean
417,newcastle to london heathrow with british airways i was pleasantly surprised plane was on time and spotlessly clean professional staff bottle of water crackers and crisps handed out lovely deplaning with special covid social distancing system working well
418,due to the coronavirus situation i bought a return ticket back to my home country singapore from london where i currently reside because the first wave of asia in march was done i was due to fly back to london on th august and my flight got cancelled before my flight cancellation i got an email from the airline that i could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled so i applied for an online voucher but i was told that i am not eligible to get a voucher because i have done the london to singapore leg a month later i tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow i was successful but to redeem the voucher i have to call to redeem the voucher which i think it is a complete joke and i was put on hold for many hours
419,british airways canceled my flight to london on june due to covid it is july and they still have not refunded my money ive reached out to executives after trying the usual customer service path nothing has worked they will not call me and will not provide me any resolution they are blatantly ignoring emails asking for help avoid british airways service is nonexistent and they will keep your money they are keeping almost us of our money
420,london to frankfurt i made the mistake of exchanging my april flights with ba for a voucher because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic big mistake ba has failed completely and does not seem to care i tried to book an august flight using the voucher but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher you have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost then no email confirmation for hours after i chased it up another long wait on hold email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund a few days later i started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date still not the one i wanted but better and weeks later ba cancelled the return flight so i called for a refund to be told if it hasnt appeared in my account after days to get back in touch things go wrong its how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service ba hasnt a clue
421,ba cancelled my flight to lyon marchapril because of the corona crisis i could not obtain a refund as the ba website and telephone service made this impossible it just sent me round in circles so i opted for a future travel voucher as this could be obtained via the website i have now tried to use the voucher for a flight to munich and was informed by the website that i have to call ba for this the silver card member phone number is inaccessible as ba has reduced telephone access to one number i have now called this number five times each time i was told to call at another time as in these difficult times they had to protect staff this is exactly the same message that i received the many times i called for a refund is ba not honouring their voucher system trying to fob off customers and keep their money this is appalling business practice
422,a short hop from london to edinburgh in november efficient clean and punctual the airport experience was straightforward and i think flying from city you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable i got my luggage quickly at the other end and i appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from
423,total rip off british airways cancels flights due to pandemic covid when i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional for a first class seat british airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic
424,i booked flights to rome from the us and then home through london to lax in february of this year for the st of august i booked through american airlines and then i paid for seat selection for people through the ba website paying us in total with the pandemic it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to italy and england on this trip as we are not allowed to travel outside the us as americans we are not allowed to travel to italy or england and the us government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early february i had to cancel all of our hotels airbbs car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds andor vouchers ive tried to reach british airways customer service a number of times finally got through today after an hour on hold i asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that i had paid for and was told that i will lose the money i paid that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed because i booked the trip through american airlines and not through british airways my understanding is that ba and aa have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners though i was shocked at having to pay nearly just to reserve our seats in business class but this is apparently not the case i was told that if ba cancels the two flights that we are booked on that i might be able to get either a voucher or a refund i was prepared today to accept a voucher that i could use when i rebook this trip for as i understand that ba and all airlines are suffering financially as much as i am but i was not prepared to be totally ripped off by ba i cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly august st to cancel this as i will lose the money and miles i paid american airlines for this flight i am at a loss as to what i can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that i valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund i will never again do anything that gives revenue to british airways
425,i booked a trip to spain for midmarch with american airlines british airways and iberia i needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to europe that began in march i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began those tickets should have been refunded if i were to have boarded that flight i would have been quarantined in europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon reentry to the us if i were able to return at all the fact that british airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since i do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to spain with the travel ban enforced the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available im very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them
426,i booked london to tel aviv in jan to attend a school reunion i booked economy ba then sent me an upgrade offer which i accepted at an additional so i would fly premium in the new plane covid hit and they cancelled the flight no fault of theirs their subsequent behaviour was all their fault after a mammoth effort to contact them i was offered a full refund this took months and many calls to get and they deducted as a service fee for the upgrade calls and emails all result in the same robotic response as you made a post booking change we are unable to offer a full refund
427,i booked my honeymoon flight from san diego to barcelona in september i have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel especially to other countries i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great however this is my honeymoon and i paid in advance for seats to ensure i sat next to my would be wife this was more than in additional cost the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available i then asked if i wanted to make sure i sat next to my would be wife they expected me to pay again the answer was yes im very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again
428,this company is withholding my money after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher even though i called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel bane initially they had said no refunds the only thing to do was get a voucher after we had ordered they announce you can get refund if flight is cancelled and you dont have voucher
429,tokyo to london hours without anything to eat because the sandwich i was given was inedible there was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours total waste of money having paid for premium economy i am aware it was the beginning of the covid issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from british airways their attitude is unacceptable it is all about money with them
430,flight ba on february was delayed mins due to mechanical in london and so i misconnected at london heathrow and arrived hrs mins late i requested compensation and was refused for three emails they told me my flight to london was delayed mins under the mins floor and i continued to reply that i did not fly to london but to paris and arrived mins late then they started writing that i was able to make my original connexion which is untrue i dont know whether to fault their greed at persisting in this lie or their incompetence
431,london heathrow to toronto my wife and i used avios and the ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday i was also excited to fly on an a for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations the breakfast buffet in the ba lounge in heathrow t was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees the aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting very comfortable spacious seats and large highresolution ife screens i like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available we both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew the a is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the and 
432,my wife and i used avios and my ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon the checkin and security were very efficient and the lounge not belonging to ba was clean but had a more limited range of food than i would have expected boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional i am a big fan of the iconic but we flew out on one of bas new as and this brought home to me that the business class is looking tired and old in comparison the seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality ife screen was behind the times however it was a night flight so i slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tailwinds
433,i flew with ba recently from sydney to london deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation the first ticket i booked with them was via hong kong after booking hk closed its borders so i could no longer get this flight i rang up ba who advised that the hk flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldnt yet book me onto a new flight yet the customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight ba would be putting me on as a replacement am came and went the next day and i had not received a phone call i tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for hours and still no one answered i decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and i didnt want to end up stuck in australia i had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt i had no other choice when i got back home i raised this with ba they told me that i was supposed to process an involuntary change to get a replacement flight that is not what the customer agent advised me id never even heard that term before he simply said ba would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight he didnt say i had to do anything so now because i was given the incorrect advice i am out of pocket by a considerable amount i raised it with the ba complaints team that i had been advised incorrectly and if i had been told i needed to do an involuntary change myself i would have done so they were extremely unhelpful and just said that they dont know why i was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it when i said that wasnt good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if i wanted but they were not prepared to do anything i will never use this airline again
434,during the time of covid it is normal that a airline has to cancel their flight im ok with that also when it means that i had to reorganize a few things whats definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher you cant use their voucher online or for a cheap flight on the hotline they offer you no online fare and just way more expensive prices so stay far away from their voucher for me as a regular traveler i will avoid ba as much as possible in the future i even wont use my miles with ba
435,do not accept a british airways evoucher go for a refund i stupidly accepted evouchers and they are a waste of time they have no flexibility and despite the fact that ba has money and air miles belonging to me i cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight only an air miles flight that they dont have available at the time and route i want ba are trying every trick in the book to complicate frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still you cant redeem the cancelled flight voucher online only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to phone them i was a loyal silver card executive club member and still am but after bas approach i will be avoiding them wherever possible in future
436,londonheathrow to warsaw on th march british airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience starting from check in and ending on the deplaning very friendly smiling chatty people throughout my journey including the lovely captain who gave all the information about delay missed slot and new departure time what is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here the boarding procedure was very well organised no chaos with groups boarding sequentially i didnt try the paid marksspencer on board service but i think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free the one thing i can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean the toilet was filthy
437,just before the borders were closed in south africa due to corona virus i went to the airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned there was no international flight customer service staff available so i was not able to get a response the only number available was a uk number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire next day i managed to get on board the flight sadly due to my fault i forgot my laptop inside the aircraft on arrival to terminal i was one of the last passengers to leave the plane i realised my mistake after i passed security and i was not allowed back into the airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and i understand why i could not go back to the aircraft they gave me a number to call and i have been calling the number since march so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items basically ba does not have means in place for passengers to find their items my laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence i just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was left inside the plane lessons learned avoid if you can
438,at checkin desk at t heathrow was told by ba staff that sweden only allowing swedish nationals into country this was contrary to advice on swedish government website i rang the border control office at arlanda airport they confirmed that eueftaeea uk nationals were clear to enter the country i offered the phone to ba staff to clear up any confusion they declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy i spent the next hour trying to get through to ba on the telephone for a refund the calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes ba standard of service compared to the other major european airlines was dishonest and obstructive furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time ba should be able to do the same while inflight staff at ba are still terrific they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy
439,i booked a flight with them on of march but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictions since then i am trying to call them every day i also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a week today i finally managed to spoke to the lady on the phone from their cs but she just directed me to their website or she gave me another number this number directed me to call again the first number i called already after minutes of waiting again i spoke to another lady she asked me for my reference and said she will transfer me to someone else when she hang up on me unbelievable so you can not even call them and when you finally speak with someone no help at all i never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus
440,a journey of halves before hand multiple lies and lack of information from the ba website they cancelled my flight but they werent honest about what they had done and lied they claimed that i could rebook and showed lots of flights none were in fact scheduled to fly but ba claimed that they were full then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that all journeys complete website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the usa to uk impossible to get through to ba in london usa ba much better a total wait of hour minutes to make calls staff at the call centre efficient and helpful chaos at chicago as most passengers had american issued boarding passes for the ba flight to london and ba werent accepting those boarding passes no explanation for the change in policy everyone i saw merely handed in the american boarding pass and was given a ba boarding pass on the plane the staff were excellent as usual food was good verging on very good breakfast a little small but tasty i even got a nd cup of tea journey smooth with some sleep i stopped flying ba for years because the head office is so poor the staff on the ground are good but ba as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed eg over securing clients data telling passengers what is going on running a decent frequent flier programme design of the business cabin stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo and so on i only fly ba because of the lack of choice on most routes whenever there is an alternative i try that not american airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than ba
441,i flew to vancouver mid march to see my mother then in hospital three days after arrival my mother passed away and i subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral i tried to manage my booking online as ba suggest but because i had bought a package that included car hire the ba site said i was unable to change this online and i had to call their customer services i spent over hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online i set up conversations facebook and twitter they went unanswered on the second day of my telephone ordeal i actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in holidays who said he couldnt help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line when this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting i managed to blurt out my ref number nothing else before that call was disconnected thankfully the one person i had briefly spoken to in the duty office that night then emailed me back and i was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight this change took about minutes over a few emails but the person helping me couldnt extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected the only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company but two days previously when i tried to manage my booking online i was told i couldnt do this because i had bought a package and that this could only be done by ba i do totally understand the turmoil caused by covid but never again ba
442,very disappointed that ba are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid effectively holding onto my money illegally do whats right and make it straightforward to do it online a voucher is not sufficient or get more phone operators the virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a hour wait on the phone very disappointed i expect much better from you
443,i booked my flights to the uk in may and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on march and because i am older and have preexisting health conditions my doctor asked me to postpone our trip the british airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were nonrefundable now the problem is i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may for travel to the uk by may or lose all the credit from our trip how can i make travel arrangements by may with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place i understand ba has policies in place but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline my preferred airline is still british airways british airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisisand make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them whether a consumer has purchased refundable or nonrefundable tickets should not matter because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers remember there are many other airlines out there to choose from the coronavirus is something that no one has any control of i guess the bottom line is i think british airways needs to put some common sense to their policy i want to rebook and travel but i am hesitant to this at this time hopefully may this pandemic is over for all of us
444,mumbai to london heathrow i wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flight someone had erroneously accused me of being on a flight from goa to mumbai and coughing throughout the journey categorically i was not on that flight but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when i repeatedly said so the stewards dealt with this situation with tact absolute professionalism and great courtesy all the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment they are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can get home safely and i wish to thank our crew in particular for what they did
445,i have a booking for march th london heathrow to valencia and ba still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund option the ba website was updated on march to state were working closely with the foreign commonwealth office fco to continue flying where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so i then checked the fco website that was also updated on march and it states the foreign and commonwealth office fco advises against all but essential travel to spain so it is clear that ba deem it safe to fly to spain despite the fco statement i know the airline is suffering like the rest of uk industry and business but how can they get away with such deceitful practices it is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds and are not complying with the british fco advisory is this actually legal
446,london gatwick to funchal british airways are still forcing people to fly to madeira when the foreign office has advised against anything other than essential travel my wife and her friend were due to fly to madeira on march for a weeks holiday when we found out that the fo had advised against travelling there the madeira government had ruled that new arrivals would spend days in quarantine no matter how long their stay thats a week longer than their proposed stay her friend contacted ba but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on they offered a voucher if this is an example of bas customer service i am not surprised they are in trouble
447,lower deck club class seat with the current awful narrow business class facing seats british airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best and club class is simply terrible my food was not fit for consumption wifi broken crew morale low ife quality a bad joke to add insult to injury the amenity packs are contemptible what makes ba management think that business people require or indeed would retain a package of socks mask plastic pen and disposable tooth brush the ongoing decline of this oncegreat national airline is palpable
448,london to new york jfk another grim flight with british airways in club class on a tired and old b the business class at ba is by far the worst in the industry the dreaded ying yang configuration is going to be with us for some time sadly in flight entertainment with tiny screen no hd and poor movie selection wifi did not work as usual food continues to be desperately poor and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly this airline needs major overhaul and investment in new aircraft and seats
449,diabolical that british airways are still forcing people to fly to madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the foreign office have advised against anything other than essential travel what a way to treat their customers if that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble
450,frankfurt to buenos aires via london in october the aircraft is very old with small screens and ample entertainment which becomes an issue flying hrs the hour layover was a complete disaster the staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me
451,london to paris return group booking cancelled i know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline but ba appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it is proving impossible to speak with them after the constant it debacles this airline has surely it is time for heads at the top to roll cancelled my booking for flight refund online but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards however the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information a year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that ba currently has and my patience of being loyal to ba for over years i might add has run out the management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line
452,london city to berlin on th march flight got canceled the lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogant extremely rude staff and service this is no way to treat passengers especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled
453,london to beijing in january ba has really upped their game now a few years back i took ba the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since however my recent flight is good the flight was delayed for hour due to mechanical reasons but get back majority of the delay in the air food is tasty and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry the drinks are offered in the promote manner and crews are really willing to engage with you in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep seat is a bit tight but understood i am flying economy so this is bearable the return flight has been cancelled it takes like calls emails and they finally sorted out our flight this could be improved but i appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not bas partner overall ba has really improved the game and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world
454,hong kong to london great airline indeed staff were friendly and helpful the aircraft was very clean the crews are diverse will definitely fly again
455,mumbai to london the check in process was quick efficient and friendly unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure but ba kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court information explanation and apology over the delay was given by the first officer which we were happy with the entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually worked good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though very happy with the service
456,london to delhi this booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to bag drop according to the check in screen all zones were applicable for our destination but we were sent from one zone to the next which given the size of the t check in hall wasnt helpful eventually we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude especially when we discovered we were seated separately it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats fortunately the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight with great service and positive friendly attitude i actually praised them and told them that my faith in ba had been restored
457,paris to london flight cancelled due to atc restrictions after storm ciara and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by hours arrived in london hours later than planned initially and ba refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason booked flights to italy for march all cancelled last thursday booked lgwbgylgw and next day cancelled for last week of march a month away been a gold member of ba since and after seeing their constant downgrades i will go back with airfranceklm for my travel needs ai found thr food and seats on euro business a shame
458,i flew from sydney to london to visit my seriously ill mother the second leg from singapore to london was with british airways my return flight from london to sydney was with british airways leaving february on february it became clear that mum did not have long to live i contacted ba who said i should be able to change my return date and asked me to send medical documentation which i did with an explanatory email sadly mum passed away very early on the morning of february i contacted ba again the next day they said because i had booked through webjet i needed to contact them i phoned them they said they would contact ba no follow up from either when i phoned webjet again they said still no word from ba when i phoned ba again they said they couldnt help at this point i gave up and booked with qantas paying for another flight bas complete lack of compassion apart from a couple of platitudes and lack of interest in helping me in any way astounded me needless to say i will never use british airways again
459,gatwick to malaga nothing special nowadays theres unfortunately not much difference between ba easyjet flight left gatwick late arrived in malaga late ba seats no longer recline food and drinks are expensive their cream tea excludes tea lift your game ba your product just continues to get worse
460,vancouver to london there are time when british airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriers this flight proves the point from the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at lhr the crew were outstanding friendly attentive and professional the dinner was excellent excellent choices on the menu accompanied by some decent wines i had a painful back from running a flight attendant provided some medication came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when i deplaned very thoughtful seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket ife good the b is showing its age but its still a wonderful iconic aircraft to fly on and ill continue to prefer it over the b
461,i am flying london to seattle in business class in may and british airways wants around each way for me to choose seats all other airlines i have encountered allow business class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost they decided to change my seat for operational reasonss what could that reason be the plane is the same so ba takes off me for me so that i can choose my seat and then changes my seat without asking me what i get is an automated message the next time i log on to the ba website to tell me there is a number i can ring minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and i give up
462,london heathrow to nairobi ba first is so much weaker than that of middle eastern and asian airlines i despair the brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the cx lounge at heathrow t to cram firstclass seats onto a is quite an achievement but it is the food that is the standout problem on board it is poor and it is shameful that our flagcarrier represents britain so badly in this regards conversely the flight attendants were excellent in both directions i only flew first because bas business class is so poor but never again
463,dubai to london my husband and i traveled together he got business class my ticket was a last minute addon so was premium economy instead after we boarded my husband came to me to give me his pillow so i got settled and started sleeping i was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband gave me and saying that there is a lady in business class is missing a pillow did i take the pillow i told her i didnt and the pillow was given to me i stood up and told her it wasnt ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow and ill show her whom my husband is who gave me the pillow i located my husband in the business class apparently his seat had extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one he offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he could keep it
464,london to cape town gone are the days in which british airways was a great airline weird seat configuration service that needs training horrible food and no internet in business class are basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by ba
465,rio de janeiro to london economy packed out seating awful food very narrow seats uncomfortable expensive add ons seat choice luggage try to match norwegian pricing on the rio route ife was iffy my back and legs have been terrible for days i paid for an exit seat the breakfast served was unfit for me i took my own drinks and some food items long haul is getting the same as short come prepared
466,johannesburg to dublin via london i get to the counter and require a transit visa since when and why if you are in the same terminal even there was no support guidance or remorse from the staff i also had a non refundable hotel booking in dublin ba need to communicate such changes
467,las vegas to paris via london the staff were great but the was the most uncomfortable flight in business class ive experienced the aisle seat felt like i was sitting in the aisle a business class configuration of thats a tight squeeze andthere were backward facing seats the seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration i was just glad i didnt pay full price for this flight
468,ba cancelled my return flight on feb from geneva to gatwick due to storm ciara they rebooked me onto a later flight then cancelled that as well since then i heard nothing more and i was left on my own to buy a new return flight ive tried calling them several times every day but they are not answering their phones claiming they are too busy to talk to customers they cancelled my flight so i want a refund but so far there is no way of getting through to them
469,mexico city to manchester via london my plane from mexico city to london was smooth entertainment was quite nice and so was the food although i chose a window seat and was never informed it wasnt actually the window but a wall the crew was amazingly kind and lovely theyre always checking on you and we even got a magnum loved this airline for my first flight ever
470,london heathrow to sofia a good experience onboard one of bas recently refreshed a cabins although unfortunately without any inseat power supply contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get inseat power following refresh another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the ba product however the flight overall was very good as usual an extremely efficient preflight experience at heathrows excellent t fast track security was fast as expected galleries club lounge was pretty good and not too crowded boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual the crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight the food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering i found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a ft chap so overall a good experience with no major complaints
471,i was to fly to melbourne from manchester via london and singapore in july arriving late to board my heathrow flight the checkinstaff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor only option being to find my way to heathrow i somehow managed to get to heathrow in time where only the singapore to melbourne boarding pass was issued i was told that because manchester to heathrow flight was missed my heathrow to singapore was cancelled
472,madrid to london i keep giving ba the benefit of the doubt but things are getting worse not better this a has cramped business class seats no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin despite every statement they make about catering improvements i simply refer to meal photos on this route in or to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost iberia staff in madrid were all very nice cabin staff okay but overall club europe is not worth the money dont waste your money on this
473,prague to london this is the first time i have flown with british airways the flight departed earlier than intended and got to heathrow about minutes early however at heathrow there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early a negative was at the checkin partly the websites fault as we had done the online check in we selected the amount of bags we each had it said we would have to pay extra and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay for each bag apart from those negatives and the delay i would definitely fly this airline again
474,johannesburg to london whoever designed the refurbished galleries lounge at jnb has no understanding of acoustics as every syllable of a facetime conversation was audible feet away add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience thankfully the upper deck of the a was more civilised with an efficient if slightly distant cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by hours after takeoff allowing plenty of time for sleep food was mediocre and ive given up expecting anything more from bas business class product the white company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement and breakfast has become rather perfunctory with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant arrival at a chilly lhr was ahead of schedule and we were curbside minutes after landing reliability is currently bas strongest card
475,las vegas to gatwick a very disappointing service for club world it felt like i was travelling in economy with attitude especially considering the very high cost of the flight ive paid half as much less for business class returns to australia we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne about cm in the bottom of the glass my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered when i queried it i got a lecture on this was how it should be no wine arrived with dinner until i asked for it a second time out of stock of the first choice no second glass of wine offered yes i could have used the call button but of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a hour business class flight other than the initial bottle of water and a glass of water with dinner no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask the good news is the food was good and well presented although the promised on the menu selection of pastries with breakfast were not served i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast we had dutifully filled in the preorder card for breakfast only to find we were being asked again at breakfast sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high i actually thought i had a fever i was so drenched in sweat until i spoke to a colleague who was the same im used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines so im used to hot cabins but this was crazy only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing presumably to wake us up was it bearable enough to sleep combined with the a very dry cabin air it was very unpleasant no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window i do like the semireclined position for take off and landing though i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down being on the second aisle we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark so it wasnt quick at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed but the service was budget airline level really ba you need to do much much better the ground staff in las vegas were fast friendly and efficient the lounge was something from the dark ages all s wooden panels
476,san diego to stockholm via london had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten but i realise this would be unfair ba is a game of two halves the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago the food in club is excellent the cabin crew attentive and professional the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers the problems start when anything goes wrong which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on noncore routes in my case the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft an ancient going technical then a comedy of errors first the hotel vouchers just said holiday inn there are about in san diego cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc next the replacement flights the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me were confirmed or whatever on calling ba they wouldnt talk to me because i failed security i didnt know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my companys travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used the next day i went to take the replacement flights alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane i was pulled off minutes before takeoff ba had not paid for the flight a reservation had been created but no ticket issued ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a hour layover from am to pm getting me home over hours after my original reservation later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online why was i not on this when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to exceptionally change my flight again after i complained about all of the above finally i arrived home after a hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence in summary when all goes well ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job but old planes rubbish back office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong and bear in mind i was travelling in business class who knows how they treat economy passengers
477,cape town to johannesburg the slow lounge at cape town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink including ingenious winedispensing machines boarding was quick and takeoff was exactly on time there was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed the club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray arrival was minutes ahead of schedule
478,on th of december before my flights departure i got my purse stolen in nyc with all my money and my passport in it thanks to the kind strangers i managed to get to the danish embassy and get a temporary passport when i arrived at the jfk airport it was too late and i wasnt allowed to drop off my luggage with tears in my eyes i went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful she booked me on to the next flight for free got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened when i finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as i havent had any food for the whole day as i didnt have any money i want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that i got back to denmark safely i was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff once again thank you
479,phoenix to london since moving to the usa ive been flying ba more than in the past and overall they provide a more than acceptable service if you choose your seat in club world carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations the new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting on this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good departed phx early and arrived into lhr early where immigration and baggage took minutes if you manage your expectations with ba then you wont be disappointed with club world
480,london heathrow to bangkok done this route a few times with british airways over the years first time and probably last in economy old plane needs upgrade poor entertainment system uncomfortable seats especially for hour flight i know theyre starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy
481,mumbai to boston via london my flight with british airways was really good the catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good however some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the ife box blocking space in front of you also ba had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in they have a really weird policy that you cant carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead you have to check it in the ground staff was rude at logan airport in boston also they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in boston hrs after i had come even after contacting bas baggage customer service they were speaking rudely to me they always tried to cut my call in like minutes without even listening to my concern british airways needs to improve their ground experience
482,i purchased roundtrip tickets for my wife and i to travel from orlando florida to accra ghana and i purchased advance seat assignments unfortunately british airways only gave me the seats i paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtrip i have been fighting with british airways to get my refund for these seat assignments they have only provided me with refund of despite several phone calls and filing multiple online calls and providing them with detailed my fightcontinues their customer service is really poor i will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again
483,toronto to geneva via london i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service apparently things have improved somewhat since so i decided to give them another try overall i was happy with my experience save for two major gripes on the plus side i flew on new aircraft which were comfortable albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft same with all airlines legroom on the was generous and seemed to be more than the official pilots were very good and informative as always with ba quality of food on longhaul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches i rather enjoyed the meals served which were on nice large trays the ife was just about adequate though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft cathay pacifics is far superior the two major downsides the new basic economy fare it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers ba really need to get rid of it virtually everyone on longhaul has to check in a bag so please just include it in all airfare types if i wanted to be nickleanddimed id fly to gatwick on a charter airline also not being able to choose a seat even at the time of checkin is infuriating i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay thankfully the lady at checkin changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely no complimentary catering on shorthaul seeing as virtually all passengers flying tofrom heathrow are connecting tofrom longhaul flights with ba and have spent at least on their airfare i resented a drink and snack not being included on the shorthaul segment of my trip ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on lowcost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip if ba would get rid of these two new features i would not hesitate to fly with them again as everything else about my trip was pleasant as it is i would still consider other airlines
484,hong kong to london heathrow with british airways one of the best flights ive had in a premium cabin the service seat food and wine are among the best ive experienced the only gripe i had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by ba the cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch i would not hesitate flying first class with ba on my next flight
485,san jose to amsterdam via london layout of boeing cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins row d e and f in addition the crew fill the bins over the outer seats row k j with their bags and blankets i would not recommend ba or the 
486,singapore to paris via london the flight was a ok dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience however our luggage was not loaded onto the flight the second time this happened now with ba and despite a hour flight hour stopover and hour flight to paris ba did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue instead after travelling for around hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing being a sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadnt loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than hours after arrival meaning out of days in paris will be spent without luggage
487,warsaw to london everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight professional crew with beams on their faces new aircraft its important to choose a seat no further than row in aneo as those seats are the old type pinnacle seats and have better legroom very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off very much appreciated on time landing and good atmosphere on board the food in euro traveller is unfortunately no longer free however being in bas executive club you can pay for the food drinks with avios which is very convenient the only drawback i could find is a long queue to the bag checkin at warsaw airport opened checkin counters for approx people is rather not enough
488,new york to london heathrow very good staff very nice comfortable seats seat recline good enough food a bit limited i would recommend ba to others since they are a very good airline
489,london to los angeles take off was delayed by hrs which we spent onboard because of a dent to the door which needed inspection sure maybe outside of their control i was flying with my wife and two kids sitting on bulkhead with seats and using the baby bassinet facility after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service for the whole section not whole cabin was not working and we were sitting into an hr overnight flight with two little ones meaning sleeping was not going to happen we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation sorry they said during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around to cap it off we landed at pm et and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller we finally received them back days later conclusion never fly ba again
490,british airways comair johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched back rows service followed the usual pattern of a drink champagne included and comairs idiosyncratic fourcourse meal ie a tiny salad a hot course that one could see before choosing a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese biscuits the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering aside from the meal the flight was typically efficient with arrival slightly ahead of schedule
491,london to bangkok its not what it used to be but most importantly it does not deliver what it promises any longer disappointing food outdated and uncomfortable seats appalling baggage handling at lhr and mediocre crew service onboard the customer service online is just as bad my most recent experience was early january when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in club world on an overnight flight from lhr to bkk baby screams could not sleep and as the cabin was full they could not move me the couple was very nice apologetic and we just had to bear the hours long haul flight together however my dealings with customer service was appalling when is ba going to offer a kids free zone in club world for people who need to work or sleep
492,london to johannesburg departure was slightly delayed by mph gusts but once away the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck seats jk are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet the dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film cabin crew were pleasant and attentive toilets were kept clean throughout the flight arrival was minutes behind time but baggage collection and customs were mercifully quick so we were in the slow lounge just minutes after landing overall a good flight
493,overall a very comfortable flight with british airways both of my flights took off on time and reached on time i was really excited to fly ba since they changed the aircraft from boeing to a boeing which is known as the queen of the skies the flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds on my second flight to mumbai the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service however during the lunch service they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian overall my both flights with ba were good there are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of usb ports power outlet old ife the ife box in front of you that blocks your legroom ba need to refurbish their old cabins on boeing and boeing if they still plan to use them on longer flights
494,los angeles to london on th january and my husbands seat was broken the customer service manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentions it was a dreadful way to end our honeymoon and left a bitter taste a truly horrendous experience
495,gatwick to cancun flight was late my food was bad and it was not possible to change i paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the time was advised to report but no instructions to where or how
496,fantastic flight travelled solo from london gatwick to glasgow in british airways club europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service i arrived at gatwick around hours prior to departure all ba club world passengers are entitled to fast track security at gatwick this was quick and the staff were pleasant enough the lounge at gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey boarding was quick and the flight departed ontime and landed minutes early the crew were very attentive and friendly the inflight meal was delicious i had smoked salmon served with curried rice overall a really lovely flying experience had there been eversoslightly more leg room and inflight entertainment id have given this flight a fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline
497,rio de janeiro to london heathrow love this aircraft only a class business world traveller plus and economy class cabins in business class front rows and rear rows i had seat a in my opinion the seat window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat at a little extra helps very private tucked behind second galley area toilet is over the other side jk i settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately a good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about minutes before breakfast i really enjoyed the fruit yoghurt muesli and the full english breakfast all in all great service good flight and felt fully relaxed
498,gatwick to tirana i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat to three seats behind me the seats were the same seats you have in economy the difference being that the middle seat is empty thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats i encountered odd problems with the meal as well the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service flight left on time and landed early british airways have in my opinion the best inflight wfi service for pounds you get unlimited very high speed wifi where you can stream youtube videos they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts
499,keflavik to london heathrow cabin crew were amazing weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough expecting a delay and seeing other european flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding snow in blizzard conditions we were surprised but got settled in our seats crew very friendly and a long story short after hours on the ground waiting for the diicing machine we finally made our way to take off all the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the ba online app to help them nonalcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time the first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not ba fault that the deicing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for takeoff how the pilot and team managed this in these conditions i will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to heathrow cabin crew provided excellent service being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely so just want to thank you ba we know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we cant fault you particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us well done
500,fly economy and youll be paying more for an awful service the london to vancouver route uses old planes the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible
501,my partner and i spent christmas in tokyo the flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly our experience back home was completely different the staff were incredibly rude and lazy the flight was hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water the lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself my partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from both our tvs stopped working mid flight also for a period of minutes we asked the staff if they could fix the problem the lady said she would try while sighing as year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to i can tell you british airways will not be it terrible customer service
502,london to hong kong at the entrance to the ba business lounge there was a sign saying silver and gold members only my membership had just dropped to bronze while my wifes remained at silver at the reception desk i asked why bronze wasnt allowed and was only told i could enter as a guest of my wifes when i got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and i can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest no warm greeting just a jobs worth high handed attitude neither of the ba reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly had they done so they would have seen that it was a business class ticket and i had the right to enter under my own steam anyway fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer
503,los angeles to london heathrow if i could give ba a zero stars i would they have the worst customer service ive flown many airlines around the world with my family but surely we will never fly with british airways again they gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets months in advance to ensure that our family flew hour flight together the flight to london didnt have the best service most toilets were out of service the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class ive flown the checkin process at heathrow was disastrous the most inefficient process with no human assistances the limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers i would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier i wish i would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them
504,istanbul to london we had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up hrs before departure time to check in we had to wait for minutes before any check in staff turned up once they did the staff were surly and rude on the flight and there was no ife no free drink or snack or a map to track the flight the onboard crew were a bit chaotic serving ms food for purchase the flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth however the ba product is now tired and slightly pathetic
505,london to bucharest on my flight the hot food finished half way through i was seated on row and by the time the food cart reached my row there were no sandwiches left to purchase the fitting of the cabin was horrendous seat change from one row to the other h before take off cost me an additional gbp
506,london heathrow to rio de janeiro not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites this aircraft today has a first class but was flown empty as it usually only offers club world flight not full seated in f aisle seat no one in the middle seat so very pleasant it is away from the toilet over at ab but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight food preordered was very good as usual plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist again nothing any trouble at all i did watch some films but i had already been on a previous ba long haul so was not really looking for much i had some rest as it was a long day and i getting a cold arrived late due to a technical problem at heathrow they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour i must say i didnt really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate all in all another very good flight
507,london to athens the aircraft and the flight quality were good but they dont provide free food and drink it was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling so it ended quickly
508,copenhagen to london super slow had to wait for buses which were delayed also packed the buses to tight with people where too far from arrival terminals service bad from staff coming to terminal is the worst terminal on heathrow the food and beverage on board was terrible for the price for the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff
509,budapest to billund return via london on and dec a aircrafts checkin in budapest had a narrow timeslot of hours before departure with long queues i was not recognised as oneworld elite flyer hold a gold card with qatar airways at checkin and had to struggle to get bags accepted as inscribed luggage i was denied lounge access as qr does not honour rd party lounges any more unless flying on qr there is no oneworld lounge in budapest so ba uses menzies lounge who would not accept me unless i was with an entitled oneworld card different from qatar airways for ba i do not have status in london granted access to any oneworld lounge onboard food and drinks with hefty price tags water is not free flights were full but on time i found that the onboard charity collection by fas is inappropriate and intrusive luggage delivered perfectly return trips legs were both full flights but departed slightly early granted lounge access in billund in the decent king amlet and ba galleries first in t in london loads of good hot foods and good beers and wines onboard there is no ife no seat recline mediocre not cheap but the ffp is among the best in oneworld and the gold status of ba is very rewarding
510,i recently flew from cape town in south africa via london to brussels it was our anniversary and we were treated to a glass of bubbly after take off the staff were so friendly and i cannot even complain about the food served on board which i might add i seldom enjoy food served on flights
511,sydney to toulouse via singapore london boeing and ife ancient the comfort and service superb highlight on the tlslhr sector a celebratory treat with mince pie christmas cake brandy butter which combined with a gt hit the spot you could argue it should be free but im not complaining i do miss the ba quality of service but compared to the me airlines youre still pretty good
512,sofia to london a good overall experience departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in sofia and complete failure to honour priority boarding flight experience generally good and arrival experience at heathrow very good and efficient
513,my husband and i had a wonderful flight to barbados the cabin crew were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble josey and her team were made the the journey amazing having flown with virgin for many years i can say its night and day tank you your staff are amazing we will be british airways in the future many thanks
514,london to munich ba on december delayed by mins dated not very clean a boarding process was slow and asking passengers to check their hand luggage turns out plane is half empty no complementary drinks and snacks will be served on this flight with buy onboard in economy never again
515,hong kong to london i booked a return ticket for my sister though ba provided travel document details they required however when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didnt match her passport name they refused to let her fly after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa they enable her to fly however once landing in london i acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to taiwan igot in contact with bas executive phone helpline service yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things we have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on ba are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket they have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand they were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from taiwan and i told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her they did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke english to her
516,my husband and i used british airways to fly from london to paris this past august when we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags was charged times for one bag after i was assured charges didnt go through have been trying to get a refund from ba since they give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone they have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails i sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that i had been charged times for one bag only months later did they finally respond to the claim claiming i had two bags and despite the fact that i sent documentation showing charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through they only saw two charges and since i had two bags they didnt owe me any money they force you to communicate via email and then dont respond they owe me usd and refuse to give me my money at this point
517,new york to london i was on the last flight out at pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects the boeing certainly showed its age ife screen was tiny seat was well used the flight time was quick hours and thats about it fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me the f b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier im a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier usually followed by a drink or two
518,austin to london along with an purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter ba charged an additional for seat reservations to ensure they sat together when they went to check in those seat reservations in both directions had been given away and family had to sit in different seats back home i applied for a refund of the seat fee and was told there was no proof i paid for them i have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made but there is no process to upload those documents to ba
519,frankfurt to london with british airways awful airline put me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane even though we booked together gave me middle seat even though many others were free a childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you dont book biz class avoid
520,london to glasgow with british airways flight is again delayed its not like its a one off as its delayed every week like a bad joke really a poor yet very expensive airline who i wouldnt recommend to any traveller
521,london to san francisco this flight was a delight friendly relaxed crew good food and wine and a main deck club world cabin that was nearly empty if you manage your expectations with ba club world and everything goes as it should then you shouldnt be disappointed yes the rollout of the new club world suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably ba are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of worlds favourite airline the has seen better days however given theyre being removed from most airlines passenger services you should take the opportunity to fly one before theyre gone im gradually regaining my confidence in ba
522,heathrow to belfast great service in belfast but absolutely shocking in t at heathrow very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases totally disgusted cabin crew were lovely on the flight to belfast on th december
523,london to singapore i was apprehensive about flying ba club world after reading many negative reviews i was however surprised firstly they are not on part with sq or qr but to be fair i found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings you get what you pay for the seat while old is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space the window seats are best for privacy i am tall and had no issues sleeping in fact i slept for almost hours the service and food out of london was top notch fresh and plentiful which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on qantas service was consistent polite and very attentive drinks and water continually topped up i was truly impressed the return flights service was very average and quite sloppy but lets focus on the positives
524,toulouse to london im a able bodied fit ba customer and silver member and was seated at an emergency exit seat id put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions a cabin crew member came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and i was listening to him and responding despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers which he called earplugs i explained to him that i needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and i can suffer from ear problems when i fly i told him i could hear him perfectly as demonstrated by our vocal exchange despite this he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should i fail to follow his order after i begrudgingly took them off he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and i pointed out i already had i then asked to speak to the purser who came to see me after take off i told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed customer care training or indeed to look for a new job i wrote in to british airways with my complaint but they have not even bothered to respond awful rude airline
525,london heathrow to stockholm business class shorthaul is what it is seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat but you get served drinks and food proper gin for the gt and good food
526,johannesburg to london we had limited recline seats on an hour overnight flight at checked in we asked and were told we had good seats completed a complaint and asked why ba thought this was ok how come their representatives are allowed to lie never flying ba again
527,johannesburg to london the recently refurbished first and club world lounge at jnb has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to lhr descend on it theres more table space for eating and the food has improved but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues the predominantly young mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled the meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course the food itself wasnt at all bad when it was finally served the cabin temperature wasnt too hot and we both slept quite well arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick overall a good flight despite the aged club world product
528,london heathrow to miami flying the boeing unfortunately ba hasnt done much work on their first class on these aircraft seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my makes the beds small and since its so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side these seats are business class on for example qatar airways and i still think a first class ticket should include wifi but as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful meals are impeccable
529,stockholm to london heathrow as always ba works excellent with service on the ground and in the air they still have a good gin aboard for a decent gt and even if the meals in business looks like the came from the s economy they taste great
530,london to sydney via singapore flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic meals were great leaving london we had a chicken stir fry and landing into singapore at we were served an english breakfast which i can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd at singapore all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean when reboarding you had to go through a security check at the gate we were on the ground in singapore for hour min nd leg to sydney was great also food and drink service was great again hours long haul flight was comfortable we had exit row seating for entire flight which i recommend to anyone over ft tall
531,london to new york jfk we were booked on brussels airlines two of us which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on ba the flight bru to london was fine but the transatlantic leg and heathrow airport terminal were utter nightmares never again will i go to or through heathrow however this review is about bas to jfk an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago how does ba have the gall to call its service business class the seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent aside from that i now understand why ba has such a horrendous and welldeserved reputation never again
532,the first thing is the shortage of staff the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken unfortunately although they were pleasant the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there werent any i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken at the end of the flight i discovered the switch despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping i had to ask for a cup of tea times there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they would not offer a third there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack i am not a big eater but i was peckish the layout of the business cabin is cramped i am and i could not stretch out the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers this means no one has a easy seat you either have to climb or be climbed over i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers unfortunately upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didnt get any better after one hour minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing
533,brussels to bangkok via london club world from london to bangkok on nov seats c and d it was a boeing with a seat configuration in the business cabin which gives the cabin a crowded impression the seats are comfortable with a flat bed mattress good selection of entertainment although a rather small screen the food menu offers different choices of starters main course and desserts the food was disappointing i had smoked salmon as a starter and british beef as main course my soup was cold mybeef was overcooked and quantity was economy classlike the service is very friendly but not personal im used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class while serving the meals they forget serving me wine the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin after dinner i went to sleep the seat is turned into a real bed with an extra mattress and a good pillow the space is narrow it is difficult to make the bed once the bed is made there is no place to put personal stuff i had a real good night of sleep though if your seat is not at the aisle you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet the toilets are small and simple not cleaned frequently enough when i woke up breakfast service was running the breakfast is good yoghurt pastries fresh fruit and a full english breakfast overall british airways world club is a rather standard business class lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience if ba wants to compete they have a long way to go i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight
534,san francisco to oslo via london the head support was damaged so i had to sit hours leaned forward the flight from san francisco was delayed so i missed my connecting flight in london to oslo i came first to the ba counter but received a new flight hours minutes later rude staff gave me a voucher for gbp
535,i had a connection flight from london to berlin traveling with hand luggage i got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that i need to check my baggage he has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass if the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage the flight arrived in berlin minutes late
536,london to johannesburg with british airways bas b gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the galleries lounges in the main terminal its also a tad closer on the transit or via the rather useful walkway on level to the c gates where the as depart from the new boarding by groups meant snaking queues but at least group moved fairly speedily the club world were still the same much maligned seats with the small unresponsive ife screens and limited selection of films the dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat trolleys may lack glamour but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight breakfast was adequate but nothing more landing was exactly on time overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average
537,london to bangalore the flight from bangalore to london on november was delayed by hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight my return from london to bangalore was initially delayed by hrs we were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for mins announcement was made the flight was delayed hrs mins due to maintenance
538,london to sydney via singapore i would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at heathrow when i lost my passport on thursday evening st november they spent nearly hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found mins before my flight was due to leave a big thank you to you all i would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight basingapore to sydney november who were so kind after i was taken ill during the flight i was looked after so well
539,lisbon to london i pay extra to check my bag to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space to have british airways charge me euros to check a bag to my final destination and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat in a cramped aircraft to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags is an insult will never fly ba again
540,ba operate daily shuttles from london to glasgow its a busy route and im sure make money plus there is no competition however ba flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passengers are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed enroute from some far flung exotic location because i have several buses and trains to catch after i reach glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to ba hence im very disappointed with the service they provide
541,doha to london surprisingly good flight ontime departure and early arrival by min very very attentive and friendly crew especially towards children food was halal since from doha clearly announced to passengers bag arrival was ok seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation
542,london to buenos aires we paid extra on top of our holiday cost to fly with them as it was a direct flight firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel the plane was old and cramped making it difficult to get up and walk around during the hour flight the entertainment system was pathetic not much film choice a random selection of tv programmes and no games the drinks service was lacking my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between on other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrushtoothpaste etc no such offerings
543,san francisco to london a is a wonderful aeroplane movie selection was below average staff were polite fist time i used the call button midflight response was fast but on second occasion i was repeatedly ignored call button for minutes i dont see how that is acceptable
544,sydney to singapore with british airways packed in like sardines in a tin can what a disappointment of an airline they pack you in and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration you awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze my seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past very narrow passage ways would not and could not recommended this airline these seats are at best premium economy
545,london to mauritius we are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines without a shadow of a doubt the whole british airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight i truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver i begrudge flying with them and given the option i always choose a different airline
546,los angeles to amsterdam via london due to delayed take off i risked missing my connecting flight thanks to the excellent premium host service julie and her colleague i managed to be on time thank you very much
547,london to vancouver i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively i flew on the th and it was a remarkably bad experience food service was very poor in most aspects i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing rather tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed i had to ask twice for a beer before it was deliveredthis then put me out of sync with the service the one time yes one time offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality on a hr flight engagement is pretty critical our hostesshost seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old i had become so accustomed to a normalnewish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place the screen size was the equivalent of your phones no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad on this or similar routes i have flown air canada westjet virgin atlantic air transat ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul
548,the flight departure was delayed due to what the captain described in his announcement as a mix up with paperwork disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a mix up with landing bridge allocation so the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found we missed our connecting flight the staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didnt know what to do we ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay all of this inconvenience is due to bas incompetent management my seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree the flight attendants are rude it used to be a good airline
549,london heathrow to lisbon mediocre the flight was very smooth and arrived on time cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions no bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a nudge before it was delivered not a great club europe experience
550,london to boston comfortable flight in economy class food was fairly good both ways dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east got some solid sleep in on the flight back
551,tirana to london gatwick i fly british airways around six times a month thanks to my work and while i almost always have a pleasant experience this past flight definitely outdid all the others we boarded and departed exactly on time with a very friendly and welcoming crew while the flight was fully booked my travel companion and i were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat and therefore more space the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wifi which i have never had on any other british airways flight within europe in fact the wifi package i got which included only texting was unlimited and incredibly fast as good as my home connection this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me something that british airways can improve on would be leg space which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight although that is a common problem for me as i am cm tall also for unknown reasons no food or snacks were served on this hours minute flight only drinks this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast but i managed well the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we deboarded quickly i always recommend ba and will continue to do so
552,gatwick to st lucia great service on this flight thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew excellent service
553,london to singapore i have to commend ba staff on this occasion they were friendly welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness thank you ba for making a long journey a tolerable one
554,london to san francisco return in economy the seats are small outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible im only and female but couldnt lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings if you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you you will need to do some major maneuvering touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable i flew on a both ways they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm i had to ask them to turn up the ac both ways i was literally sweating economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class asian vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible asian vegetarian breakfast in economy plus is much better i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights its not worth it
555,gatwick to venice we have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects on the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service it was welcome and efficient particularly as the gate was a very distant one the flight departed to time the cabin staff were pleasant the food was good in flight information from the flight deck was good the landings were noticeably smooth the return journey was similarly good i was very satisfied
556,bordeaux to gatwick british airways cancelled my september flight due to the pilots strike with advance notice i made alternative travel arrangements confirmed that i wanted to to cancel from my end in order to receive a refund and received confirmation from ba on august ba refunded my fare soon enough but i am still awaiting a refund for the euro cost of baggage that i paid six weeks later i lodged a complaint on th october no action i lodged another complaint on th october and still no action they cancelled my flight and wont refund my money and they call it customer service
557,seychelles to london day time flight back to london staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats jk best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window k seat has direct access to the aisle ontime departure and swift meal services nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment i have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to london the easiest to travel on seat and screens worked great and no problems i loved every minute of the flight a big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic looking forward to my next flight to rio in december
558,london to belfast british airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion i booked my parents on ba to attend my investiture at the palace my mother had a heart attack months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and i had chosen ba expecting the best level of service instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff my mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and i booked my parents on aisle seats side by side i printed their boarding passes out myself with seats c and d on arrival at checkin one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one on going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed my father explained the situation but the rep at checkin started quoting the geneva convention that ba are only contracted to get them from a to b and could change seats if they wanted waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances at no stage did they receive any apologetic words for someone recovering from a heart attack this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion i have been holding on with the hope that bas slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed i will await bas response to my parents i know they will not fly the carrier again but i will be handing back my ba amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued will update in summary dont trust ba with your loved ones care
559,london to cape town we had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to africa i usually fly star alliance but picked ba for a segment for better connection timing through london to cape town this was a huge mistake i had tried to reserve seats on ba website twice and was not able to do so then i tried to call ba twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option when we arrived today in london from toronto at the connections desk seven hours before our flight we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy bas representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats we were at the bottom of the list for business class and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us but we would still be welcome in the lounge as if this was a bonus then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge since they could not print our boarding passes due to the down grade it took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk we asked to speak to a manager but at each of our four interactions with ba staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could at one point i got visibly frustrated after the ba staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary which it definitely was not after two and a half hours ba customer service managers came to speak with us they were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective if british airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight i will not be booking flights on ba again
560,san jose to london the tv screen of f was broken could not be locked into position that would allow to watch movies flight attendants could not fix it and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in the back of the seat in front was dirty the tray on the d where i was moved to had a hole on the right side and the tv screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch although my husband in e and me turned in the breakfast cards together the flight attendant insisted they dont have it and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast flight attendants were doing their best but it seems that they were understaffed
561,london heathrow to edinburgh boarding efficient flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage by doing so they would get priority boarding i took up the offer too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the back of the plane f i am sure ryanair have more room british airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy
562,flight from gatwick to barbados check in and business lounge were good it looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive breakfast was good flight left on time boarding well run i have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok new configuration but that does come with panasonic ife system which is way better than the old rockwell collins systems food was fine and service friendly
563,we were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our icelandair flight and rebooked onto ba direct from toronto to london heathrow we tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into gatwick the flight was quite good service was fantastic and the chicken tikka masala was tasty the crew onboard was friendly flight was on time and landing was amazingly smooth
564,i was travelling from jeddah to london with a bag i arrive hour minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed i tried my best but there was no staff to help me so i have to leave my bag as i was not allowed to take the bag on the plane in london i made a complaint but they were saying that we cant do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about hour and minutes of wait
565,zurich to london return both legs travelled with hand luggage only and i could not choose a seat without paying fair enough but when there are empty rows either side of strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least hand luggage fares are last to board make them uncomfortable on board no free food nor drink
566,san francisco to london efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at per person which we declined refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks boarding on time but could have been better controlled flight left and landed ahead of schedule flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints
567,london to belfast check in was fast and efficient and using the ba terminal first class check in and security area was really good and i was straight into the lounge great selection of food and drinks early morning i really like the ba boarding process ieby group numbers the onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent overall very happy with this short flight with ba
568,london gatwick to salzburg with british airways worst customer experience i have ever had after cancelled flights due to strike action no response and when we did it was weeks between getting answers only to be told its not their fault and would not pay towards cost of changing flights back home
569,frankfurt to london flight attendants very kind when flying in return flight was canceled at london city airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking hotel voucher and transportation arranged that could be done far more efficiently no water nothing no necessities
570,hyderabad to san francisco via london i had an awesome experience with one of customer service representatives at british airways i called them with regards to a reimbursement and was put across a lady named florencia she not only helped gather all details bank address etc required for payment but also initiated the payment instantly that was certainly over and beyond what i expected great job your service is exemplary
571,vancouver to london very poor experience my flight with ba the business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class one toilet closed nobody around to repair on one point ba even better than asian companies its even more freezing why do we need to freeze in such a hours trip no staff to answer my question no staff to make it better one good point the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better
572,london to malaga a terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude at the checking at gatwick airport i was told the flight might well be delayed of h as not departed yet from malaga sms confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status at gatwick there are no arrivaldeparture boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online when asked the ba guy at the lounge kiosk he said i could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update at the gate we were told the aircraft was replaced no apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight we boarded at pm and took off at stiff and no recliner seats cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes additional seats are replacing the toilets located at the back of the and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price
573,brussels to london we were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation everyone else with a boarding pass was boarding whilst about were just looking at the operators thinking what is going on extremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators
574,my flight from london to singapore in premium economy was the worst i have experienced the seat was uncomfortable the flight tracker failed after two hours the breakfast prior to arrival in singapore scrambled egg was like rubber they ran out of cups and so my wife and i had no coffee tea or drink with our breakfast i used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than minutes eventually i made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back i never saw the crew member again
575,kuala lumpur to glasgow via london the service started first some drinks on my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant i asked for an ale the attendant pretended not to understand what i was asking for i repeated many times the word ale with my spanish accent but she still did not catch it the male attendant said like an ipa i answered yes i changed to a beer and she offered me amstel or heineken i chose amstel and had to ask for ice to make it drinkable when the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me for the meal i chose the beef and asked for a beer the male attendant realized that the empty can was still there took it with the food on my and no drinks i started to eat after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming so i stopped another attendant going to business class and he came back with an option of tiger or heineken lager the female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that abreakfast i was offered tea or coffee even decaf i accepted but there was no milk or cream for me
576,london heathrow to seychelles really great flight boarding was very quick the flight was full seats great ab good inflight entertainment plenty of choices food was good as we already preordered our meals my beef was well done just how i like it after a late minute delay we landed on time into seychelles the crew were very attentive lots of very demanding passengers all in all a good flight after hours of sleep
577,edinburgh to london heathrow i have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying everything on the plane was fine after the flight landed i rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and i had another flight out of london and only had an hour to make it even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over it took minutes before my bag came through the baggage claim service desk turned away other furious customers until a manager could arrive by which time i was running to catch my next flight on a different airline which i missed turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasnt for another days hoping that british airways would help us in some way we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent basically told us to pound sand it ended up costing my wife and i almost for new tickets to get home spent the next hours in the airport and british airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher we will never use this airline again
578,amman to london this is a nice aircraft with comfortable seats and a very soft landing this aircraft flies from amman airport at am local time and arrives in only hours to london this is a very good product
579,london to athens british airways is a glorified budget airline a hour flight and back to athens and no food or drinks provided ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price an ms inflated price sandwich is the meal no entertainment options either no usb charging on the seat as well any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in yet they charged fullservice airline prices so there is a mismatch flew aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided
580,terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy this was easily the most cramped space i have ever flown and i travel a lot the flight was hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort the little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting if the seat in front of you reclines as they invariably do there is even less room shameful the food was below average as well even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food i will never fly british airways again stars beware i should only add that the nyc jfk and london waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam horrible excuse for an airline
581,buenos aires to london heathrow rwturn the aircraft is very old cabin configuration is very old and tired ife screens have not been changed since they were first installed my ipod has a larger and more responsive screen before taking off in buenos aires some pax but not all were offered water or orange juice i never got any after take off drinks were offered followed by a hot meal food choices ran out in the first row seats were uncomfortable footrests were jammed on the return flight sparkling wine and water were offered before take off followed by drinks and the meal i had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes poor movie choices miniature screen and uncomfortable seats crew ok no indication as to which toilets to use either forward in business class or rear economy having flown norwegian on their b in their premium cabin on the same route ba is a waste of my money
582,mexico city to barcelona via london heathrow the b is an incredible plane the legroom is quite good the seat is comfortable and the ife has a great number of movies series and music the food is average the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes salad and wine not very tasty the breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms fruit and a muffin it was delicious the cabin crew was ok not bad not excellent we arrived on time and was a great flight on the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice no ife no onboard service its almost like a low cost i recommend for long flights but not for european flights
583,great all round ba october good price easy boarding lovely cabin crew great iced coffee on sale comfortable on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing couldnt ask for more until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich
584,flew back from abu dhabi in world traveller plus the seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort i got no sleep a snack was served after take off which was quite tasty but breakfast was just dismal tasteless not much interaction with the crew but they seemed friendly enough would not travel with british airways in this cabin again really not worth the price tag
585,flew from london heathrow to abu dhabi honestly they were really good legroom great crew excellent looked after us superbly food and drinks were bang on did vegas in april too nowt wrong with this airline
586,johannesburg to amsterdam via london after many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at pm the following night at pm they announced further delays due to the same technical fault reported hours previously finally departed at pm consequences were missed connecting flight to amsterdam we also had to pay for our no show at our hotel in amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from ba they declined but offered to pay for our taxi arrived in amsterdam hours later what really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated our connecting ba flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking
587,dubai to london heathrow i flew on the a on one of its first trips and will be flying it again on the same multi segment trip i tried sq business class and ek business class and sadly the old ba business class on an aging b on overnight trips the new business suite offering from ba is the best business class i have experienced i am a ba gold card holder and the experience was outstanding the first lounge at dxb was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue on board the new suite was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in the bed was very comfortable food choices were very limited soup and sandwiches although this did suit the timing of the flight i would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers i dont know but i certainly could work very effectively in my suite downside is the ife is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product
588,istanbul to new york via london literally the worst experience we have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time they should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch
589,yesterday my husband and i decided to to come home from rome earlier than the scheduled time at pm when i rang ba in london the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to pm without having to pay extra onboard the flight the steward gave me hot water and milk so that i can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me while waiting to get off the plane i had a wonderful conversation with the ba staff who are so pleasant i love flying with ba and we will continue to do so we have booked our flight with ba next year thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service
590,flight from london to athens with british airways was one of the worst experiences the new slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in pain the screens with flight info have gone no frills and airline has become a bad quality budget airline sad avoid
591,short minute flight north and south with british airways lounge at lhr and also ncl was busy but there was no shortage of seats gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits the seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time
592,calgary to gothenburg via london with british airways staff are very friendly and helpful entertainment was good food was just ok although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldnt be my first choice to serve the seats are incredibly uncomfortable super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours for a hour flight this is painful paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on recommend for short trips
593,for a long time i have avoided taking british airways due to its poor past reputation yesterday i traveled on ba from kuala lumpur to london heathrow i boarded the flight with an open mind over hours later i disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to its customers a praise is due and i want to congratulate ba for such a pleasant experience the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler what more can i say enough to say that i will be traveling with ba again
594,austin to london another pleasant flight on an ageing after the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger she kindly swapped seats so we could be together for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel youre in your own little world a good flight on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect
595,london to kuala lumpur better than i was expecting after reading the other reviews the seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg less so on the return a few areas need improvement separate toilets from economy dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service a better nd meal the main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal breakfast was a bit of an afterthought would i choose ba premium eco again yes definitely
596,i wish i could give a zero i was booked on a flight from newark to madrid via london i come to find that the minimum layover time in london is hr my flight layover in london was hrmin british airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in london were the same but that was a total lie my wife and i were sprinting across the airport but between getting off the aeroplane having to go through security again and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection we missed the layover flight we had the same route in the reverse direction i called ba hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation they kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering minutes more than londons minimum hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way british airways has by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced ryanair which is a nofrills airline has better customer service and that is saying something i will never be flying ba again and plan on converting my company away from ba flights as well be warned stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise
597,one of the reasons we traveled club class was because ba have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children ba dont tell you there is no lounge at kos airport limited seating very noisy limited facilities not sure i will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they dont warn of limited facilities it doesnt help that the flight is delayed by an hour
598,gatwick to alicante on my outbound flight sept i gave ba almost out of across the board in a review they invited me to complete on my return flight sept it was a different matter from entering alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard except the vip lounge which was good travelling club europe had no advantages only one check in open for all passengers no bag drop facilities no facility to print boarding passes when invited to board we had to wait minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane the iberia factor honestly you wouldnt have thought it was the same company once on the plane everything went like clockwork
599,vancouver to london great flight on the superb a in my opinion the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment outstanding in flight service from the crew attentive polite and professional the very best of british airways service food well above average for this cabin though breakfast could have been better ife excellent the seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket very enjoyable flight highly recommended
600,gatwick to alicante hours hour sitting on tarmac with my knees rammed against seat in front no room to move i have travelled on several airlines on this route in last months vueling airlines has best seats stay away from the rest unless you are under ft tall
601,we have had some torrid experiences with ba which we have not been shy to report so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way it felt right to feedback on that the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were frankly wonderful cheerful efficient and calm what more could you ask the food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely the beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy i literally cannot think of any real negatives the luggage lockers were quite small but then its an older model of the plane so that probably explains it if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion they would once again be the worlds favourite airline sadly the current ceo doesnt seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time as we entered the literally empty immigration area we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars surreal as anyone who regularly travels to the states will testify it felt as if we were living in the truman show at one point but in the nicest possible way get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct fantastic
602,london heathrow to austin with british airways it was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a to austin but it was the most enjoyable flight weve taken for a long time it was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldnt do enough for you and always with a smile we arrived as fresh as you can from hours in the air on time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience the only slight issue was the very ife systems and small overhead lockers but plenty of spare lockers and our ipads took are of that
603,i did not actually fly because of their pilot strike this review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike i immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to jersey but of course they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay more for a return flight i then cancelled my ba flight but they only refunded of the i had paid the difference was picking my seats how do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight they should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking i completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me weeks ago i phoned their customer service line and the person i spoke to said he would refund me the i never received the refund
604,the start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge awaiting flights on airlines other than ba as it was weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by minutes once airborne in a refitted a complete with a nice fresh leather smell cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient and the food including a cod dish was quite reasonable it was interesting to note that the refit hadnt extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear a big plus on the flight and a first for me was wifi which actually worked and was quite fast although at a cost of for an hours use i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers but evidently not landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights however ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport minutes later so not too bad all in all
605,chicago to zurich via london delays after delays the flight was supposed to depart at pm chicago time but was scheduled at pm we waited a long time at the airport finally at pm we managed to board on the a for my first time but the legroom was horrible the ife completely unfunctional and with no food served during the taxi a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate in the end the plane took off at am chicago time and we arrived in london heathrow at pm we had to wait hours for boarding for another minutes delayed flight we arrived in zurich on an old a at pm zurich time instead of the original pm very stressful at least the staff were nice
606,glasgow to london smooth flight departurearrival on time boarding was quick the seat was ok although i had preordered a vegetarian option the caterer hadnt provided any so they said but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue the food was good and the wine french bourgogne also surprisingly good flight attendant was professional polite and attentive to detail all in all a great flight
607,having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before i was apprehensive as to how it would operate the checkin and security clearance at t took only minutes personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not confident that i did everything correctly boarding is by the new fare group system to which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket again im not a fan of this possibly due to the previous days strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights the aircraft was a large a boarding was however smooth on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room im mcm and my knees do not touch the seat in front the departure was only minutes behind the scheduled departure time in flight there were cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin believe in club cabin who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline the landing at tegel was minutes ahead of schedule all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only border police carrying out immigration controls for over passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further minute wait for luggage but this was not bas fault
608,i wouldnt even rate them x business class passengers booked via on business bag lost in transit ground crew in mxp rude dismissive most unhelpful unable to locate missing bag waited for next flight to arrive still no bag decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds ok thats a lesson learnt the hard way due to this being an ob booking ba customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return apparently the bag arrived hrs later we were back in the uk despite ba website showing in transit lhrmxp for days numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless passed from one department to another then cut off after an email to their ceo director of brand and customer experience received a call from global engagement executive team offering evoucher abysmal customer services no wonder their reputation is in tatters i will never fly ba again
609,flying london city to geneva the only plus was the embraer e jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat other than that ba now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline yet it charges full service prices
610,los angeles to istanbul via london flight between london and istanbul is like coach no tv and small leg room transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed food was below average the heathrow ba business lounge was a cramped tasteless dirty lounge it took us min to find two chairs to seat food was awful and service is even worst when we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of plus fee change so we ended up paying per person in addition to the fare already paid
611,phoenix to tel aviv via london the return from london to phoenix was a nightmare i want everyone to know that i sent a complaint times but there is no one to talk to this is not something that i am used to
612,london to kefalonia the t galleries lounge is showing its age and was packed at on a saturday boarding was by the now standard groups which meant waiting minutes in a queue and then minutes on the bridge the flight deck then informed us that wed be waiting on a stand for hr minutes before our departure slot once in the air cabin crew delivered the usual club europe experience which was mediocre at best fortunately arrival was only minutes late and we were out of kefalonia airport minutes later overall a typical ba experience thats lacklustre at best
613,london to dublin it was never my choice to fly with british airways and i will never fly with them again i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago unfortunately my first flight was delayed due to weather which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin i was put on a flight to london instead which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago and my bag did not make it on the flight i then flew with british airways from london to dublin i was told to file a lost baggage claim with ba which i did i was told that the bag would be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin using americans baggage tracking system i was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday i am writing this review on the following sunday and the bag is still not in my possession bas customer service is terrible if someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient i am going to lose it my bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city im in for more than a day and i cant get it talk about serious frustration i dont know which airline is at fault for the delay but the difference is that when i called american the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag and even though their baggage claim desk was closed when i called she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around unfortunately she couldnt get hold of anyone but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning i did not receive that level of service from ba i even asked if they could call the airport and was told we are not authorized to call airports why in the world wouldnt they be authorized to call their own baggage department i am not thrilled with either airline but at least american has made some attempt to help me this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years if you do check a bag and its lost or delayed dont expect any help if you flew with ba and heres a tip if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you dont live in dont call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into you will get a lot more information and assistance that way
614,hong kong to london an email on the th august advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone what a total awful nightmare then the email at pm saying i must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled all slots in the elemis salon were already booked so no massages were available in first class arriving at hk airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel we had to wait ages for ba to open a check in desk pretty average food and service in the qantas lounge a broken screen in seat a it would not stay in position and without wedging unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him a ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane i had already been to the ba desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt first class out to hk was a good business class experience the return flight in business class was in a word poor the plane was tired ife faulty poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff they were lovely but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish the night term pantry offering was a total joke i have been a ba exec card holder since for ever and i have seen is a decline in the service level certainly not value for money we did not get a club class experience on the flight home
615,gatwick to seville when my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay gbp because one of the suitcases was cm oversize and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage staff said that if he did not pay he would lose the flight
616,london to abujaflight full aircraft an older version of evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near abuja return flight delayed pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at lagos and had to be flown back to abuja with a hour delay flight was supposed to be a am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight the crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improvedscrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow full credit to the crew cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc the aircraft was clean but old and down at heel the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the floor was visible
617,london to bangkok what an awful plane seats are just about ok going coming back it seemed like a bar going across the bottom back part of the seat really uncomfortable the meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushed the main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about films rubbish took hours to get the screens to actually work the plane looks old and tired not a pleasure to travel on this plane
618,belfast to san francisco via london checkin at belfast city was fast and trouble free and security was completed within just a few minutes with no queues to mention boarding was direct from the business lounge and on time as was departure a full breakfast service was carried out including hot towels hot breakfast tea and coffee along with drinks from the bar on request the galleries lounge in terminal at heathrow was very busy with limited seats available boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift the inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner food was plentiful and tasty entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine no complaints at all about the flight and would recommend british airways
619,london to gothenburg ba are getting a lot of bad press deservedly so at present with strikes it glitches baggage problems however extreme cases will always be highlighted two recent flights on ba and very happy with them flight to gothenburg on a pushed back m late due to a potential technical issue soon resolved and arrived at got only m behind schedule good crew and the safety announcement video was a hoot return to lhr on a on time departure and early arrival at t again good crew will be flying with ba again in december strikes permitting still recommended by me as the national carrier
620,orlando to gatwick terrible flight experience bed bugs in old club world seats missed meals poor service complaints is outsourced to a german company who arent even part of ba do not fly ba and club world is a waste of money
621,mahe to stockholm via london checked in online before the flight but had to do the bag drop was met by a rude lady at first class check in and the process took about minutes dont know why no apology the boarding was in time the welcome wasnt especially friendly just pointing the direction where to go the club europe cabin felt claustrophobic i had a window seat the csm never came to say hello the service was pretty basic ok during the meals but self service between no drink service if you didnt ask on the flight to stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members the service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly the seating was terrible on this a so tight
622,glasgow to tampa via gatwick early morning flight glasgow to gatwick flight dud take off at boarded with doors closed by bug did not depart till due to gatwick being busy smooth flight down gatwick to tampa according to manage my booking aircraft changed days prior to departure at boarding was told our world traveller plus seats had been upgraded to club world a very pleasant surprise if was on which had not been refurbished extra space was very good staff were very efficient and pleasant only downside was the main meal which i would have had in original seats but main courses were not to my liking but afternoon tea was very good so thank you ba for the experience
623,orlando to gatwick travelling home was extremely disappointing the aircraft was dirty drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt the aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers the aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult the breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar only one drinks run was made the standards on ba have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago such a shame i hope management are looking at reviews such as this to improve service
624,london to abu dhabi this is the daytime flight from london a very good flight the food was excellent for economy particularly in view of etihads disastrous changes in food service the childrens meals were excellent the entertainment system was great with a good selection it makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate especially when flying with children etihad why dont you do this the cabin crew were good economy in the is cramped but probably no worse than many good value flight especially as the only other carrier to abu dhabi is etihad
625,london to st petersburgh huge disappointment for ba business class service in european routes seat pitch has been reduced to over the last years from at the expense of passenger comfort seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat food for me was halfempty plates representing a deli experience and leaving me hungry out of the three options offered two were already out of stock so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option avoid club europe not worth the money
626,sydney to london via singapore with british airways i made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight the food was horrendous i was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed overcooked potatoes and maybe other vegetables i am not sure for one meal and an ice cold frittatasandwich which should clearly have been heated up the latter i took one bite and couldnt continue i have had better meals in economy class in other airlines the seat was nothing to write home about but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class with the price difference to match of course the service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available on the plus side i am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights paid for inflight wifi for an a hour disconnected after minutes and no longer able to use reasonable price and speed
627,london to johannesburg british airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel but in addition if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments with that said in my wife and i made reservations on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october specifically yes thats the day called for brexit only we made our reservations before those dates were set considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september coupled with brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection the good news is close to in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage the bad news is the we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses i was just not feeling the love here so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airways all of the other outstanding carriers dont charge nearly the high fees and most dont charge for reserving your seats in advance instead of ba we changed our booking to on etihad airways through abu dhabi their customer service was outstanding the fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other i am entering travel in september because there was no other option for future travel this request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight this is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware
628,i have to say travelling in club europe is a waste of money the food was no better than economy food from the past the seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people this might be a british trait as ive travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience
629,i had a stress free journey with my yr old autistic son and yr old girl from chennai to london by british airways the chennai ground service manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley screening the luggage checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person i am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth thank you so much inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if i need any help and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard i did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at heathrow airport over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with ba and heathrow airport happyautism thank you
630,edinburgh to kuala lumpur via london i have just returned to kl from an extended visit in uk seeing family and friends my return flight was ba from heathrow to kuala lumpur on monday th august at i was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name i didnt quite catch the point i wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight she was exceptional it really made the journey one of the best on board experiences i have had
631,i was supposed to fly from london city to amsterdam on business class once at lcy my early pm flight appeared as cancelled a state of confusion broke out at the airport with people trying to find alternatives however i managed to be rebooked on a later flight on a busy day i waited for hours at the airport the new flight was displayed as delayed for mins the delay kept on increasing with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after pm i kept on waiting the flight eventually ended up cancelled as well result half a day wasted at lcy i feel that bas punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately delays and cancellations can happen however i have been flying ba times a year and the of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately especially tofrom amsterdam and germany also the customer service seems to have a minimum care proposition provide what is strictly required by the law only if customers complain taking as long as possible that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer whether you are a frequent flyer or not
632,i purchased a ticket for dublin to mauritius on british airways for feb on the day of travel a few hours before the departure time i realized that i would not be able to make it and so i got in touch with british airways on twitter advising them of my cancellation when i arrived home i asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund i understood that my ticket was a nonrefundable one but it says on the ticket that surcharges taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least euro however all the airline refunded me was a pitiful euro i have been trying to speak to british airways on twitter many times over the past few months and they never responded positively only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change british airways is being dishonest and should be avoided
633,london to shanghai the concorde room in heathrow terminal was amazing the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious however the first galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad on the plane the crew was very friendly and nice dinner service was finished hour after take off the food was okay bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable perhaps the best i have had the entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like qatar airlines and emirates overall the journey was great
634,i have often flown british airways and have considered them a good airline however their customer service has fallen to such a level that i must say it is terrible if you have no problems this is a good airline if you have any problems you will not be able to get any help i recently flew to london from chicago they erroneously cancelled my seats although i had checked in over hours before he flight they then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane they then lost my luggage for days these things happen but customer service was impossible to use when you call you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up if you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you they do not you cant find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you
635,good morning i would like to write a review for british airways it took me a while to write this review as i it took me a while to get over what happened to me but i feel that the way british airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts last year i went with my year old son and my year old friend to new orleans from london on the holiday of a life time i was pregnant at the time the baby died while i was on holiday there and i was in a turmoil of emotions regardless i tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in england somehow i missed the flight back i have no excuse for this when i realised i was in a complete state i had a break down i rang ba and sobbed down the phone they were beyond amazing they arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost we all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and i was in hospital the day afterwards customer service was outstanding so compassionate and helpful and again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights i am beyond grateful for their help i will only ever fly ba on long haul if possible
636,my flight was cancelled days in a row was flying out on thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with ba i got a flight out saturday night with swiss air they on the other hand actually fly and on time everything about the customer service customer relations has been terrible hours of waiting on the phone no answers on email my other flights with ba this year has been delayed too they have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of first days then bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yet so far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to caa and the danish aviation authority
637,hong kong to copenhagen via london the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air bb house in marstal in cph on or before rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on th august on nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to th august instead of and we could not correct it by ourselves on rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the th august they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in marstal on th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which bag was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the th we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at pm on the th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we couldnt find our luggage and the staff didnt explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the th how come it would disappear on the th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing you cant imagine how furious and frustrated we were we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage thats how ridiculous things have been for us we are sure that you could do something about it my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day of our trip
638,london gatwick to san jose costa rica this was a very similar experience outbound and inbound i am sure the plane was the same i am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen ba i am seriously considering not doing this again the we flew in business was dirty and old i flew my family of business class but of the seats did not operate no headphones socket jack that operated the screens were from the ark crew as always excellent but ba should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience i was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue i have heard to date zip at least it was better than last year flying into dc from london when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster that time at least we received avios the customer service is increasingly low cost in feel
639,inflight crew were very helpful polite and caring though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines it was quite pleasant the food and drink selection was pretty basic however the ground staff especially at the check in counter in dxb and lost found at london heathrow were rude and very unhelpful i forgot to collect my suit which i had handed to crew member at the time of boarding upon approaching the ba counter the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain neither any empathy nor any willingness to help
640,from toronto to pisa british airways used a wet leased air belgium plane crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily food was excellent business class cabin comfortable weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at lhr to our great surprise british airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family people ranging from to years from terminal to terminal escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to pisa without this transfer help we would have missed our connection flight to pisa on time good crew good on board catering arrived minutes before the time
641,a very good service on board this flight with british airways from lhr to vce although the flight was about minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an airbus a to and airbus a we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time the crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean probably because the plane was relatively new the seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room one small issue that i could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board you had to pay or use avios it isnt that bad as it was only to europe an overall very good experience on board this flight
642,this was the worst experience i have ever had flying there was sufficient time in chicago to transfer our bags from american airlines aa verified that they delivered the bags to ba but they were not on our flight when we reached london the bags did not arrive and we spent two days in london without our bags i left a earphone hard case on the plane but your lost and found never answered to file a claim your website was horrible to use to file this claim and i have heard nothing on the return flight from london to newark your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock with an experience like this on our first vacation to london i would do everything to never fly british airways again
643,london to larnaca new aneo hour flight the aircraft was narrow the food simple nothing worth spending my money the staff was friendly but spending money on a hour flight on such a small plane doesnt worth it no entertainment onboard it is a small plane for this duration
644,gatwick to orlando excellent customer service on arriving at gatwick airport and checking in i learn that my interpretation of the usa esta rules was wrong and that i would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip this took longer than it should have and ba kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft the aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time during the flight drinks were served and two food services towards the end of the flight i developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring so despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger ba really came through for me the return journey went without a hitch and bas check in at orlando was quick and easy
645,london to munich the plane is a the seat is more comfortable than other airlines a it has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather there is enough legroom however there is no free food and drinks provided
646,london to glasgow ba customer service is unquestionably the least helpful least accommodating least friendly and least responsive so called service available they clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers i will try to avoid this airline from this point on
647,the seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardines the seats are aging and uncomfortable the forwardbackward configuration is the most stupid i have seen the cabin had seats to a row and about people packed into a crowded and noisy cabin to book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck hours ahead of the flight
648,no problems at the airport in vienna it was easy to find the british airways check in desk the flight was on time the cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant i also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was very delicious the only problem was at heathrow because the gate bridge had a malfunction so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft but it is not an airliner mistake after all i enjoyed the flight with british airways
649,malaga to london heathrow a shambolic airline rude and incompetent iberia ground staff in malaga ba sent warning of the hour delay just before the late boarding began sophisticated it setup they have club europe meal remains a big cutback from despite what ba claim cabin staff were bored from the start and despite serving in club cabin the service was very poor arrived heathrow at and then sat waiting mins for ground staff to show up simply appalling trip and truly ripped off
650,sydney to singapore extremely disappointed trip they are unable to even track our checked baggage when we found it was missing on the baggage carousel our baggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they cant even tell if the baggage was loaded or not at departure many important things are in the checked baggage and well have further trip later on which affected us badly no response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged
651,london heathrow to inverness having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with ba so far this summer i felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home i was rebooked on after shortnotice cancellation which i had to wait over a day for was also cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft we were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go eventually got off the plane to utter chaos mixed messages being given by ground crew some people given details about rebooking others given nothing some people were sent texts with rebooking options others including me received nothing vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels however some people were only given one bus voucher meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told theyd have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers utterly appalling now im hoping against hope i might make it home today days after setting off
652,heathrow to glasgow again flight is delayed its easier to use the train than fly with ba the staff dont even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers trouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave it very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service
653,a supremely awful experience from beginning to end flight to vancouver delayed by hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between only told once on board what the problem was delays at baggage reclaim meant i didnt get out of vancouver airport until after midnight originally scheduled to arrive pm this affected a camping trip the booking for which could not be changed flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane due to it faults none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew due to more it faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the hour flight food was awful and we got a choice of one meal spent hours at heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled queued for hours to get some information from someone they rebooked me on a flight for hours later without checking this was ok only discovered it was over a day later when i was handed my boarding pass this means ive missed a trip with friends to the edinburgh festival had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses a lot of money coming out of my account whilst i wait for this now im seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that theres no telling whether my bags will arrive with me i have to wait at baggage reclaim and see if they are not on the flight i have no information as to when i can expect to have my belongings back with me these are merely the most significant issues there were more and im really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided between this massive fines for data breaches and the fact that ba seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with it it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business
654,british airways flight to brussels from heathrow check in problems and a hugely delayed flight pay premium prices for a below average service they need to invest in their it systems and greatly up their game
655,london to nice i agree totally with the comments made in michael crofts review today my flight to nice was cancelled as a result of the lowcost and unreliable it system that ba have while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs the handling of the situation at heathrow was despicable and you would think that with all the failures that ba encounter these days they would have got this part of their act together they make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue when clearly they have not been investing where they should instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses not just the ceo should go but some others at the top
656,palma to london heathrow how does british airways get away with having such a useless it system and presumably team of it staff management these issues recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some heads to roll preferably from the ceo down just read a fatuously stupid interview with alex cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in let alone try to make himself look all ecofriendly with such comments i have been a loyal customer for over years and it seems that ba have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of ba without complaint until now my patience has run out
657,london city to ibiza disappointing all the flights were cancelled without explanation presumably because the striking staff didnt turn up so trip was ruined got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week trip was basic the meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits british airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines easily beaten by easyjet
658,london to faro we booked our tickets family of two months before the flight with british airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service so we thought inbound flight seats has been booked and paid quite high amount for seats for the row and outbound flight row and two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from british airways weve found out that our seats has been moved to unlucky inbound and to a outbound theyve split all family quite far away apart from each other as well customer service has hang up on us for the first time and second phone call has promised to call back but never did will i ever over pay difference so i can have good customer service with british airways ever again the answer is no i am extremely upset that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason disappointed and you can no longer rely on british airways
659,calgary to london staff were not in high standards looked rushed and not polite did not look professional enough in our flight back to london staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft there was not welcome snacks we sat in the very last row and food choice ended only chicken was our option to have very sad and staff did not care about this situation
660,london heathrow to sofia we checked in online so we went straight to baggage drop it was quick and worked well our bag was kg maximum is kg so we had to take kg out after that we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags show our passport and then go through to security my daughter was beeped but it wasnt a big deal it was fast and our flight was departing in h m we got some drinks and then we noticed our gate was announced early we headed to the gate and boarding began about m later boarding was fast and we were sitting in seats def the seats were comfortable leather and had headrests a so there was no ife we had a hour delay from the bad airspace but eventually took off our route was a little different instead of going over france switzerland etc we went over germany hungary etc the food was good and wasnt too expensive we didnt buy anything really just food while coming into bulgaria the views were nice the landing was pretty good despite the bump eventually we got off hour late and we went home the verdict is that british airways are pretty good despite the delay
661,nice to kuwait via london my flight from nice was delayed in the plane for hours and in delayed in heathrow for hours when we finally left the plane there were no information on how i get another connecting flight since due to the delay i had to miss it then i had to pass through immigration which lasted for hours there was no one at the desk just a piece of paper with a number that says for complaints call us now it was am with no one to speak too and i still dont have my bags i had to grab a taxi to sleep ba didnt not provide a hotel stay i i then had to leave the apartment at am to get to the next flight with kuwait airways
662,buenos aires to london heathrow my wife and i flew back from argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess amelia who gave great service to everyone with her friendly professional manner on finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card the trip itself left on time and arrived in london early the aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable the entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen 
663,hong kong to london heathrow this is a long haul flight operated by boeing er the seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable the legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat this negatively affects the legroom the films provided are not that many but i can see the flight path through the personal television they provide dinner and breakfast for me it is quite abundant but not very delicious
664,what happened to a great airline got to heathrow hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only operators and then after minutes a rd appeared minutes later a ba guy asks for vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through there was operator on this line and it took another minutes waited over hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding got to las vegas and waited at baggage claim for over minutes no bag got to ba desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been members of staff at bag claim to tell us no apology just a shrug of shoulders during day receive offers from ba to upgrade to club class and i try at least times to book but website does not process speak to ba at st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising get through to manager who admits the ba website is the worst and advises to keep trying book in online for return and web accepts the bags stated on web as bags ring ba and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff get vegas hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are no ba staff available in the whole airport until hours before flight what a useless organisation i must state staff on plane very good
665,london heathrow to malaga in business class full and very large club europe cabin on this morning flight held in the airbridge for mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why on boarding cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers not a great start usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money the breakfast standards full english are about the same as a charter flight standard and despite what ba shout about this has gone through some considerable cost cutting ba can perform well on a good day but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed male cabin staff was quite offensive to some arabic customers in front which was a shocker
666,i was flying ba to delhi in economy because my original flight with swissair was cancelled the aircraft is looking old the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens films are ok the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone and the food is just ok the flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time allowing for the rerouting around pakistani airspace
667,seattle to durban via london on th of july i arrived late just before departure time hrs the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel the british airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart i rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents when i was rushing back to the security i met the lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in durban as i sat down in the plane another british airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in durban on my arrival in durban i got all my bags including my back pack i would like to say thank you to the british airways staff especially the lovely ladies who checked me in its a pity i didnt get their names i was panicky thank you so much
668,london heathrow to austin hour flight in a boeing noisy cabin tiny screens collapsing headrest chocolate on my seat selection of just a half dozen films and no wifi poor food with choices running out
669,mykonos to london flight delayed and waiting to depart they are not on time be prepared to miss your connections take off hours late the staff is some of the worst i have had on airlines you may be stuck on the runway and they wont offer you any water the worst business class experience i have had
670,johannesburg to cape town return this flight was operated by comair and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business johannesburg airport and cape towns domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites they even had a coffee counter with madetoorder drinks i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row as there is actually tons of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra per exit row during the booking these seats were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a x configuration i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a downtoearth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplaneboard but since it took only minutes to board a rather full it works and makes sense i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways and they were the same price as the competition south african airways i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africas busiest air route for the price paid id be happy to fly them again
671,grenada to gatwick having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin the cabin was much smarter previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant the entertainment system was hugely improved with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated but the family really found them entertaining for me the real issue was the tight leg room i am a slim ft and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal it was for me very tight previously the seat format was it is now we were sat in the outbound although on return we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become we sat in a which was more bearable i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit despite best efforts to sleep i failed i remember the old seats being more comfortable especially for long haul service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights edible in summary it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience but seat comfort has been sacrificed which is a great pity
672,prague to london a two hour flight on th july was delayed by hours with no heads up given by ba there was no sympathy or compensation especially as our original flight was early morning and with an email informing us of the delay we could have stayed longer in the hotel
673,london to dubai lately i am frequently flying premium economy with british airways the extra comfort compared to economy class is unparalleled the seat is way more comfortable attendants are really professional and very friendly if just could add the leg rest into all the other seats and not just the first row as it used to be in the old ba premium economy seats then it would be perfect thats my only note
674,tel aviv to toronto via london the plane from london to toronto was run by air belgium the service from checkin until we received our cases here in israel was excellent the cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly the food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on flight icecream was served soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight the planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on flights i havent travelled british airways for years but i will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights
675,i flew yesterday from heathrow to manchester in business class from start to finish it was a shambles i was sent to the wrong baggage drop then to the wrong lounge i showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate the boarding process was more like a rugby scrum no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this
676,the first part from brussels to london heathrow was a fast flight however on the ground in london the problems started the gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for minutes the captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous continental breakfast in business was ok for this short flight flight to larnaca was full embarkation was prompt for business pax the team was very friendly the service started with a drink and some cookies the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser it must be said the meal was an improvement since last year decent drinks and a good champagne were available followed by coffee or tea it is a longer flight a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks
677,stockholm to london worst business class flight i have flown split seating for myself and my wife because apparently they were overbooked the meal was inedible for me and was the worst airline meal i have been served
678,seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight no drink no snack no bottle of water was offered no amenity kits when i asked they said none were left in stock they gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush which was ok and fast track invitation which was useless since no fast track is offered to british passports i was not given a menu i even had to ask for it i was not served the meal and they said it was because i was sleeping ok fine but even when i was awake no one bothered to ask me about the meal i had to ask for the menu a bottle of water and the meal and after all no apologies from the staff too many people are squeezed into business class even though i could lie down degrees i had very little space at my seat given the very expensive fare i expected a much better service for business class passengers im very disappointed and will never use it again i wont recommend british airways business class to anyone
679,premium economy dont waste your money on an overnight flight going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace the food i use this term lightly wasnt fit for dogs on our flight it was salmon we think as it didnt taste of anything a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it the veg tasted burnt bread roll was ok not really a saving grace one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and dont bother asking what was in the box left on our table i didnt bother trying it the look on other peoples faces was good enough for me to know dont bother which in comparison to the outbound flight london to orlando was worlds apart greeted with a drink which was the first of many dinner was nice the steak edible veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldnt log on so saved some money there i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane but that really shouldnt happen what is not told when booking homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you dont have to join the massive queue look for pre entered tsa line thats the one thats empty cause they tell no one about it
680,lisbon to london business class is just economy class with an empty middle seat no leg room for me meal service had no choice by the time they got halfway through business class all that was left was cod freezing cold but no blankets poor staff spent most of the flight apologising never fly british airways
681,heathrow to marseille within a few days of booking a flight for december ba advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival this is unacceptable so i opt to cancel and full refund ba then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee i have paid for seat selection i have found a claim form for refund of these fees on submission they say they will take up to days to think about it
682,madrid to london with british airways there is nothing left of business class on these flights when they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad joke seats are the same as coach they took forever to hang my jacket after i asked in three occasions they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coach seat without window see picture and on top of everything i find myself having to put my luggage just a backpack far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesnt fit anymore in coach to business class ridiculous service so not worth the x cost that a business class ticket goes for feel totally ripped off
683,gatwick to glasgow awful experience our flight arrived over hours late at pm so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car we had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and back to the airport the next day which was really expensive our new car hire was three times the price since it was last minute british airways would not help compensate because they said it wasnt their fault
684,frankfurt to london ba staff watched while security went through partners bag for around mins it required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while actually just clothes when they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight only minutes required much longer spent unloading my luggage we had checked this bag in almost hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time
685,london to olbia complete confusion the plane was delayed getting to sardinia and so we waited but following checkin at sardinia we were penned into long lines no seats extreme heat and no water in the queues the airport staff in sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed finally got onto the plane and were now delayed on the tarmac we are due to depart more than hours after our scheduled departure time but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates no water provided i felt unwell but was told they had no glasses so nothing to drink numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures after a second time of asking i was told i could buy a drink once we took off but they have no idea when that would be they need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell cabin crew just standing there doing nothing but looking perplexed
686,rotterdam to london city after waiting for hours at rotterdam airport delays i was told they rerouted my flight to amsterdam and that i needed to quickly catch a taxi that i have to pay for from rotterdam to amsterdam airport in the hope of catching the flight from there as i worried i wouldnt make it i asked to be put in a hotel fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all fights are booked there was no apology no offer of a bus or taxis to those rerouted to amsterdam and throughout the process long queue no one bothered to explain to us what was happening had i known wed be rerouted to amsterdam i wouldve left rotterdam earlier rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end what a waste of time energy money and no apology to make up for the hours or delay its quite unbelievable
687,return flight to dublin outbound galleries north fine and good breakfast flight was fine return flight was delayed by mins gate staff kept us informed lounge at dublin was generic lounge but was ok staff on both flights fine return aircraft quite new and well presented
688,barbados to gatwick we boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick i had a beer and my partner a soft drink i was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice within minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us i enquired what the meal was and we were both told pasta its all we have left everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta my partner refused her pasta and i proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy i said only one was required as i would eat the pasta glad i did i think chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt during this service no further drinks were offered except for water trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for hours they reappeared about minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake i politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread tea and coffee was served our flight out days previously was the exact opposite pleasant staff food standard but acceptable the only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers the crew turned a blind eye the positives the ife has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights i have ever been on
689,i would like to praise the outstanding courtesy and service i received from the ba cabin crew members during my flight ba from london heathrow to singapore on june the cabin crew were both friendly and attentive to their passengers needs enabling them to relax enjoy their flight i feel very proud that british airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard it really is a privilege to fly british airways
690,madrid to london heathrow this was my second trip madrid to london on british airways since may on this trip like the previous the plane broke down and we waited hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was degrees the cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the bar only ba could try to make money out of one of its technical failures i then waited another hour to pick up my suitcase as im a silver card holder i could access their business lounge in madrid i regret using it fortunately this was my last ever trip on ba
691,ba heathrow to oslo i have flown with ba a few times in the last few months i have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes i had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above and beyond for me they had gave me a free bottle of water kept asking if i was okay put their arm around me made me feel so much better the flight was super smooth and overall an amazing service thanks again ba and i will be flying again with you soon
692,hamburg to abu dhabi via london heathrow initial flight from heathrow to abu dhabi was cancelled had to fly a day earlier as flights on following days were cancelled as well service with not a free glass of water on the first leg abu dhabi to london delayed by over hrs a generous dirham voucher received from ba which was enough for a bottle of water or a coffee
693,new york to glasgow via london a routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal i had an electronic boarding pass on the ba app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions there was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task the pilot introduced the flight attendants as gorgeous which came across to me as inappropriate i would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them i had an aisle seat in a seat layout the middle seat was unoccupied enough leg space and storage space overhead a good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided the ife system was easy to use a drink service preceded the meal service i asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed ipa brewdog speedbird sensing that i might not enjoy it the attendant also gave me a heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter the entree choices were chicken and pasta i chose the later very basic food tea and coffee followed before landing a sandwich and a drink was served i could not figure out what was in the sandwich the bathroom was clean blankets and pillows were on every seat alighting was quick landing cards have been done away with for the fare i paid i was satisfied no complaints i connected to a domestic flight to glasgow the announcement of the gate was made quite late newspapers were available at the gate a worthy amenity it was a smooth flight in a seating i was in an aisle seat the next to me was empty no complimentary food or drink on this segment the two flight attendants once the plane reached cruising altitude put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs the pilot introduced them as gorgeous both on this and the earlier flight a video presentation showed off the safety instructions it was supposed to be funny and engaging i felt it was neither the accents of the actors were hard to understand the flight landed on time overall a positive experience but next time i will look into a nonstop flight to glasgow from new york the transfer at heathrow is anxietyinducing
694,london heathrow to new york the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience refreshing to see these days the quality of food and drinks was wonderful there was plenty of leg room as well we would definitely fly again with ba and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations on departure my tv did not work they tried twice to reset it for me however this did not work that was fine i resolved to reading my book just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us asked if it had been rectified i replied no but it was ok she came back with a bottle of champagne a pair of pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies not just for me but for my sister as well to say i was overwhelmed was an understatement all i can say is thank you british airways from the bottom of my heart the trip was for my birthday and you certainly made it something special
695,gatwick to bermuda boarded very quickly and on time seating area smart appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up service very good food was the best i have had from ba new crockery added to the good feel and appearance long overdue duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this highcost route the pillow is fabulous gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use for this flight and the crew even though it was full up front i hope this is a turning point for british airways thank you i am looking forward to my seychelles flight in october and my rio flight in december keep it coming
696,london heathrow to larnaca perfect the early morning departure meant that terminal was unusually quiet the galleries lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment the flight took off and landed on time the cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience arrival procedures at larnaca were incredibly efficient we completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within minutes of arriving at the gate all in all a very enjoyable trip
697,ba and return trip from gatwick to cagliari both flights on a saturday and were full aircraft was an a on both legs sat in row outbound rows behind club europe sat in row on the return leg room seemed tighter than row the brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the bmi fleet didnt bother with the new ms on board service outward but did on the return the ms sandwich was everything you would expect from an ms sandwich apart from the cost but the coffee i had and the tea my wife had were below standard it also took the cabin crew the best part of minutes to get from row to row the other members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in club europe attending to just passengers despite quite a lot of turbulence and the seat belt sign on for about minutes they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful you are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to also a queue of or passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley and they would not return to their seats the rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land outbound flight was fine inbound flight was not a great advertisement for ba perhaps standards at lgw are not as good as at lhr
698,heathrow to kalamata heathrow t to kalamata greece th june and return week later used avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom bad news took off hours late from heathrow delays to previous incoming flight but made up about hour on the journey out also left kalamata about hour late on our return but landed virtually on time seats much more comfortable with more padding than for example ryanair or jetcom so with the extra legroom the flights were pretty comfortable expensive or course ms offerings for food but tasty enough pleasant fas so all in all decent flights havent used ba for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right
699,london to gothenburg unique procedures that are not adding any order but create a lot of mess extra visa checks passport checks separate queues additional controls heathrow terminal is the most bizarre
700,amsterdam to london on th april i arrived hours before flight where i waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency after that rather lengthy delaywhen i got to the gate on time i was told the gate was shut thinking it must have been some kind of joke i noted with the british airways representatives saying that i was on time she replied yes but you were the last person everyone had made it before me my bags were already offloaded she continued to say after asking what do i do now not having the ability to ring abroad i asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no qantas office in amsterdam and they cannot help me
701,istanbul to london my first flight in economy is the new a neo the aircraft is set up with the first rows of regular seats and the remaining rows of the new extra slim economy seats the seat does not recline is very thin and ok for an hour flight however hours minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after hours the members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual ms for sale products
702,i had some difficulty from the start after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in even though i was already logged in i wanted to reserve seats and request special meals it took me days to achive this i was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats no extra legroom this bumped the price up for people by and seats were only booked on the lhrkul and return kullhr legs i had difficulty checking in using the ba app and eventually did it using malaysia airlines app checking in online was only allowed hrs before making things a little awkward being in kuching for our return leg with an hr time difference i was looking forward to flying on the boeing but it really is just a dream food choices we were told ran out at breakfast the choice was full english or just an omelette but the full english ran out or so we were told but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full english on it earlier meals were ok with beer wine and other drinks available there was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water for an over h flight i think the cabin should at least be visited times toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy the ife selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music our return flight from kl to london was very cold the boeing has no way of changing the airflow to your seat
703,london to dusseldorf no free drinks or food which is pretty normal for short haul flights crew was pretty average seat was average ground crew was pretty nice no inflight entertainment
704,london to seoul nightmare experience with british airways almost constantly my business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a hours longhauls flight lounge simy sucks cheap noisy and croweed multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table given the price it charge certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take
705,london to vancouver economy was a lot more cramped than i expected ba had crammed seats in crew were okay food reasonable really although i had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame flew back premium class more room i probably wont use them in november when i go back timing was good and air quality felt ok as i didnt get a headache
706,newcastle to delhi via london at checkin i was charged for carrying kilos extra which is of no problem i paid a total of for kilos on my flight from london to delhi during boarding i asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight i then asked for a bottle of water which she seemed to forget hours into the journey my inflight entertainment system got stuck on the tv and radio feature when the dinner was served ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash along with bread butter and a mousse delays caused by british airways resulted in the flight reaching delhi late and me missing my connecting flight but as i landed at delhi and picked my baggage from the belt a british airways staff was ready with another ticket from delhi to mumbai without me even asking
707,miami to delhi via london the ba business class i flew for the first time recently was the worst i have flown whereas most have four seats across british airways has eight the lay down beds are hard thin and short not worth the money
708,london to sydney via singapore checked in with a bag which was kg my allowance was kg i was made to repackage the bag and take two pairs of shoes out and place them in my hand luggage really i found the food on both legs of the flight horrible
709,phoenix to amsterdam via london it was hrs on a delayed flight in a cramped seat with no lights no call light no entertainment of any sort and food i found exceptionally bad the b that was terribly maintained the offer of gbp for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety
710,standard run of the mill airline for todays economy flew tel aviv to new york with a two hour layover in london heathrow crew was fine entertainment system on the london to new york leg was very nice the special meal i ordered was not on either of the two flights i called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system and was assured they were i submitted a complaint to bacom and the responses i received were lame and unacceptable not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from british airways as i suggested topping off my avios balance to a mere points my balance is around 
711,belfast city to atlanta via london heathrow t checkin was fairly smooth at belfast as it was early in the morning however when the agent called me over the check me in he was all flustered that i wasnt an elite executive club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty i knew he was working the premium line but nobody was standing in it and i was standing in the regular line when he called me after about minutes i finally got a boarding pass to go through security the flight from bhd to lhr was uneventful and barebones as nothing was served for free on the flight my boyfriend therefore hated it as were used to getting better service on american in the us but i was fully aware that ba had turned itself into a glorified easyjet once we arrived to lhr i continued by myself to atlanta on ba and was shocked at the crowded userunfriendly t although i suppose it was pretty in some ways i had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called so it felt very crowded and hot after my flight was called i found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people boarding was straightforward however and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers even in economy the flight product was just ok in my view i had an exit row aisle seat and while i had extra room and a nice headrest the seat was right by the lav so it stank ife was fine with a decent selection but it was not as complete as deltas the food was the bland equivalent of what delta serves so no brownie points there and the tea service they had was terrible we were given halfsandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages i remember years ago when ba was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile those smiles have disappeared for the most part and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there however i arrived on time and promptly got my bag the was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite so i might fly them again though i would not recommend ba due to the crowds and discomfort i experienced at t
712,buenos aires to london i wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while i was terribly sick wish i knew their names they gave me medicine a blanket and caressed my back while i was crying from the stomach ache forever grateful
713,london to nashville the worst airline transatlantic despite looking forward to flying on this new route to nashville british airways ruined this trip the flight was delayed by over three hours whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound boeing from san jose the airplane was filthy dirty in club class which is bad enough having to suffer the awful dated club class yingyang facing narrow seats with divider business class on british airways is the worst of any airline the wifi was out of service on late arrival in nashville my luggage arrived soaking wet and i was unable to change clothes on my return to the uk i contacted british airways customer relations to seek compensation and got the usual pathetic mainly computer generated insincere apology i am now forced to haggle with british airways and endure their woeful socalled customer relations department it is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier british airways treat their premium class customers with contempt this is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from heathrow
714,flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only boeing that was in old boac retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the ife was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness
715,just checked in for a flight from newcastle with ba the check in process was disgusting minutes queuing ba staff working in two desks one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from air france in the adjacent desk the process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes when the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers she seemed to take an eternity in the minutes it took us the queue never dropped below about people i have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk the adjacent jet desks had seven staffed desks and i counted staff the welcome sign displayed at the ba desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of youre in for a long wait to cap it all after enduring the queue were now delayed minutes thus far so unprofessional
716,gatwick to madrid when i arrived i waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase it didnt arrive i was asked to fill in a lost luggage form which i did and given a number to call the next day the representative said shed make sure the suitcase was delivered by pm i was out during the day when i returned later that evening there was no suitcase it hadnt been delivered the next morning sunday i phoned the number again the answer message said phone back on monday as i was leaving on sunday night this was pointless i was leaving madrid at pm my one suitcase arrived two hours before i left madrid so i spent the whole time in madrid without my medicines change of clothes toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my short valuable time buying essentials that i needed whilst there
717,my boyfriend and i wanted to return from our trip to london a day early but the ba app and website continued to glitch so i called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier i was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is each and theres a fee for them to do it over the phone thats and the price of a flight by itself we decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event the flight was delayed and arrived hr mins late we missed our event the plane was filthy and my tv didnt work i asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me its normal wear and tear but i could get toilet paper from the bathroom i called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they cant give us a refund because we got on the flight
718,i had kept my laptop bag in the overhead cabin somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldnt fit the bag in the space remaining so they kept the bag on my laptop bag when i asked the flight attendant to help me with this he asked me to keep my luggage down i was travelling with only one laptop bag placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out how fair is this
719,london to delhi a truly first class experience from check in to landing i am a frequent flyer with ba and have not always had an amazing experience this one was check in was easy and swift and the concorde room was excellent the flight itself was wonderful while i accept it isnt the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none the cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing new soft product is very good and food definitely much improved
720,london heathrow to dubai last sunday we unfortunately missed our ba flight to dubai due to unforeseen circumstances so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with emirates today we arrived at dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance at check in the ba staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight we have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought
721,london to seattle my husband and i have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in america we have always been very satisfied with the service unfortunately i was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb id like to thank the cabin crew and captain for the care i received during the last two hours of the flight advice was sought via radio i was made comfortable in the galley at least one crew member with me at all times given oxygen etc paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when i was then given a thorough medical check a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as i was not well enough to walk to the car park we met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how i was many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that i must have disturbed
722,johannesburg to london i booked a seat without luggage firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage this caused an issue when trying to seat together when the passenger without luggage tried to move seats normally a free option for standard seats you get advised that you have to pay this was not disclosed when the booking was made it was irritating because one of us was ill
723,london to milan evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty boarding by group number worked effectively and i was able to store my laptop in the overhead free newspapers were available in the jet way passengers were warmly greeted i was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently usual on board trolley service which i didnt use flight departed minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in linate minutes late return flight could have been a challenge due to italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed minutes early the cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer outstanding we were taken off the aircraft and bussed into t which i think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control all in all a couple of very good flights
724,the connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older with proper business class seats and lots of legroom pretake off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight everything went smoothly and service was good boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin much has been said about the ba yingyang seat configuration the seats are narrow and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat however the seat is very comfortable in any position and the white company bedding is excellent we had an aisle centre seats at the rear of the cabin which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger the service on this flight was superb from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight very efficient quick to respond and super friendly preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off there was a choice of starters mains and sweets or cheeseboard with a decent choice of wines breakfast offered a good choice although we were happy with just the fruit yoghurt and bread there could be no complaints in respect of catering the a is a super aircraft and very quiet but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew our connecting flight to leeds was good but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat it is a short flight but there was still a full meal service the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds the airport seems quite rundown escalator not working and few staff to be seen there was only one other arrival but we still waited over minutes for luggage to come through
725,london heathrow to los angeles very nice experience i read other reviews slamming ba but that was not the experience we had from the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive food was good not great but very good seats worked well and comfy more on that in the seat review again the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run in flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with i like over the monitors aa does a very good job on this one world route as well but i would take ba over aa if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls
726,cpt is definitely getting its act together bas galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once the upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in club world thats despite the ancient yinyang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious the dinner service was according to the new cw soft design which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually on the whole i think it works and having the triple bread roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it rather than served with the dessert breakfast has been streamlined too and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff apart from some inevitable turbulence the flight went according to plan and we touched down minutes ahead of schedule a good flight overall but an old style business class experience
727,sofia to belfast via london the legroom on the sofia to heathrow flight was terrible i am not tall but my knees were pushing against the seat in front service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices where did the service go there was a bad delay on the belfast flight we were not allowed to reenter the lounge when the plane developed a fault as we had gone through security only after minutes were we allowed to reenter the lounge service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what ba was sending us via texts the delay lasted hours minutes just short enough to avoid compensation the belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the hour flight from sofia i will never set foot on this airline again
728,lima to gatwick helpful and courteous cabin crew the seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory the screen was small and in poor condition movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor the touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally without warning increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset a hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system
729,inverness to auckland via singapore with british airways service was very good but comfort was very bad for a hour i had no more leg room than i did for an hour flight i was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer i have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights
730,i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating so my initial impression was disappointed for business class however into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available and i needed to ask for a pillow the menu guide was on cheap paper and with no convenient place to store it for reference later was very ordinary the evening meal was acceptable soup steakveg fruits was ok served with freezing cold cutlery bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles asthma puffer or water bottle the breakfast of juice and cerealyoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf from singapore to brisbane insisting i needed to collect my luggage leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight i am with some mobility problems requiring assistance so this was a worry for me when i arrived in singapore the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight
731,flight was ok minor delay didnt both me what was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at lyon airport they were training new ground staff at the same time they continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight
732,gatwick to barbados return i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful however the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us with the result that we got through arrivals quickly the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years once again when you travel west to east the crew specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin not a big deal but irritating non the less no bread was served with dinner despite there being butter on the plate so i presume it was missed my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else which was fine however as the crew were serving the remaining meals there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys when they reached our row they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wifes remaining food and lap although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made my wifes wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner once again we landed on time which was a good thing overall the return flight was extremely poor
733,marseille to london i am generally annoyed with the quality of the service i believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a ba flight i realised that i forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control i went to the ba helpdesk the staff sent me to terminal at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there luckily i decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal where they the friendly lost and found staff and not the ba staff nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me
734,the cabin crew on flight ba london to chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients i did tell them i would write a review and here it is keep up the good service and thanks
735,gatwick to malaga check in was fairly quick the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets if youre not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit the food and drink offering was very good tasty and varied on board i was lucky to be able to book the exit row which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasnt a problem for me the food offering is fairly poor really a couple of sandwiches or snacks drinks selection is better what was very nice was near the end of the flight i was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member i wouldnt expect this and im sure its just because they had a bottle to use up but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers still no wifi or wifi based in flight entertainment offered priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant my bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags overall a decent flight and very good value as i paid using avios being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus
736,boston to london heathrow was excited to experience a for the first time paid a steep for the seat selection on the upper deck was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the window seat itself was the standard one comfortable the boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft there was never a massive crowd in front of the gate the inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal the food was very mediocre at best not worth losing sleep over it there was serious bumps along the way midflight the a being so massive easily absorbed it return was on a b flight was not full but almost full the inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey the baggage drop area however was a disaster none of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers the boarding was again very orderly both outbound and inbound ife was good but not as good as some long haul carriers if both legs had similar cabin crew and food i would have scored them higher
737,london to cape town in first and our first taste of the new soft product still unfortunately a yearold that hadnt had its refurbishment and was showing its age a wardrobe door thats falling off its hinges a nontouch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that wont stay shut dont pass muster in first and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the onboard service the young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food for once nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent bedding is also improved with a good quality duvet and large pillow the ife remains the same lowres screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film the goodies bag is much better and worth taking home overall a pretty good flight but it remains to be seen what ba will do with its longinthetooth first class when their new club suites are launched
738,this review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on ba from jfk new york to heathrow on tue th may i was travelling back from new york following a few days break with girlfriends check in and boarding was all on schedulehowever it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue this resulted in over an hours delay leaving ny despite this annoying delay the cabin crew more than made up for this they were friendly polite and couldnt do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable they were all exceptional even those that were not serving in the section i was in i do hope that this information is passed on
739,london to aberdeen before boarding the flight i was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and i was boarding in group i was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the boarding gate i saw people boarding with tax free bags on top of the other bags being almost the last on the plane there was free spaces to accommodate bags i was not happy because i had the permitted allowance
740,gatwick to dubrovnik overcrowded lounges business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty lgw lounge opens one hr before some eu flights in morning only and met by a large queue and now frequent flyers dont get free baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets
741,i paid an extra for two premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed the seat felt small and was shabby the tv screen was small and very dark i tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable the whole experience was very poor not premium in any way the return flight was a code share with japan airines which was premium a whole different experience i would be happy to pay for their premium seats i would advise avoid british airways premium economy as it is far from premium i felt a complete waste of 
742,faro to heathrow flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disaster we fly club or first all the time and without fail the baggage is always last off spoke to ba desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it same happened on flight out too it is a shambles and a disgrace waited mins got cases at heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again avoid at all costs
743,vancouver to london an excellent flight on ba i travel this route several times a year and generally ba are much better than ac especially on this flight ba were way ahead of the competition seats comfortable food pretty good for economy decent wine and the in flight crew simply outstanding professional smiling friendly they embodied ba at their very best
744,gatwick to tenerife all so wrong lounge really overcrowded food on the plane pretty horrid left most of it paid for and travelling business class and allocated four rows away from my partner this is normal procedure apparently on top of a six night holiday i should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner total madness this is an airline with a self destruct button such a shamehave just booked norwegian for our next flights to barcelona and buenos aires did not even bother to look at ba
745,washington to london having travelled out to washington from heathrow on first class i wasnt overly impressed although the concorde room was relaxing and comfortable the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive the cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach my return journey couldnt have been more different the ba lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hilight of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew nothing short of amazing i was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach a fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist having had mixed levels of service with ba and always flying virgin i think ba need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training
746,rome fiumicino to london city a ba cityflyer service no wait to check in aircraft was not full we pushed back early and arrived early this route still has complimentary refreshments in economy including wine a great bonus and pleasant surprise cabin service was pleasant and professional a really excellent flight
747,london to shanghai the most disappointing business class i have flown in a long time the plane was old worn and dirty there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight it took hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off the food followed shortly which was over cooked they seemed to be short on staff however what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before id even been offered a drink the service was exceptionally poor i am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight as a gold card holder you might have thought ba would check their frequent fliers are being looked after ill return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips such as cathay jal or finnair the only reason that ive given more than one star is that i managed to sleep quite well the bedding and pillows were good ultimately though sorry ba not good enough
748,their customer service is horrible lost our bags here we sit in london after days of wearing the same clothing we fly out in hours to barcelona for a day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go i spent so much on this trip to celebrate my husbands th birthday and our th wedding anniversary it was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime we have really been trying to make light of things but not getting our bags today as its now friday and we left on tuesday am from seattle is heartbreaking not one single person at british airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy for that matter one customer service agent even asked me if we would be ok getting out to heathrow to pick them up truly the worst customer experience ive had
749,london city to zurich i fly this route a lot around times per year the flight was delayed initially by an hour i was kept up to date via the app so i was not disappointed around minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a happy birthday followed by a bottle of champagne brandy etc this was totally unexpected it made my day thanks to the crew
750,i booked a flight from bucharest to london and return and when we were at the airport they informed us that the flight will be delayed for hours from am to pm then another hour and a half until pm we lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund returning to bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not inform us about it i understand that unforeseen situation can happen but i have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life
751,london to calgary thank you to james a club world flight attendant on ba april his service was impeccable attentive and delightful i thoroughly enjoyed the flight
752,vancouver to london we were upgraded to business class at the airport the staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip really they could not have been more helpful and i would recommend them
753,miami to london heathrow with british airways top deck of with one experienced and one new crew members perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected ontime arrival and aa arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers
754,houston to london the plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem ive no problem with that i like travelling safely i thought well im sure id booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window i missed out on the airline meal and when i realised i buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water explaining the problem he fetched me a sandwich and various bits hed scrabbled together from the kitchen later when the liquid refreshment cane round both my neighbour and i requested water and i had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it
755,london to delhi the worst business class trip for us seats much smaller than business class on singapore air thai international eva air qantas not seated together same surname mr and mrs but moved after no privacy on middle seats one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes ipad makeup and sponge bag book etc filmtv selection was very limited and my choice wasnt working the food was very poor main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic no tea coffee or chocolates offered to us breakfast had no jam with the croissant nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages the crew didnt put themselves out if one pays more for business class one expects more and we didnt get it i would never choose to travel ba again
756,bucharest to london my flight with british airways was hours delayed from a european destination to london i applied for compensation for this delay initially i was informed that under eu regulations i would receive euros compensation to be informed days later that this was an error and that i was no longer getting compensated british airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances comparable with weather issues and that therefore they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight however there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not i have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy i believe that if not on legal basis british airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a hour delay within europe is significant many times i picked to fly with british airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong but this experience proved to me that its not worth investing that extra money into flying with british airways
757,london heathrow to bengaluru i found the crew very friendly and even humorous whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle i was on a seat next to the aisle we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs one air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter
758,madrid to london we paid for business class and then paid for specific seats the original booking was from iberia part of iag which operates ba iberia and air lingus ba clearly do not integrate into iberias systems since after paying for and closing our seats upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by ba these flights were operated by iberia and ba ba being the return leg from madrid to london heathrow ba explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund total joke since we paid for the seats additionally the ba said the flight was full and could not change the seats no explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by ba without notice well accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use ba or iberia again which is a shame since iberia cs has always reflected all and iag ba has let the customer down again just simply poor ba and low bar as always expected more for full fare business class rated since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats
759,dublin to london heathrow british airways offered a very good overall service on this flight i booked online and found that process very easy the caveat was not being able to select the seat i wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee the checkin lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself the flight departed ontime and the captain made frequent announcements within the previous two weeks i had flown with ba twice within europe and this flight was by the best of the thanks to the staff the flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort one curiosity was the staff handing out uk landing cards the flight was punctual and reliable
760,london to seattle my seat was on the upper deck a nice perk for seattle flights to europe ba is the only one flying s to europe from seattle overall the product is outdated service was not at the level it used to be staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum no additional service no top ups not offering water during the flight of course if you ask for something you do get it there was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck i hope ba will improve their act i certainly wont use their services in foreseeable future
761,london to gibraltar check in at t was fine lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine skilled landing in gibraltar a good flight
762,london to boston ba replaced a with a very old boeing video system did not work for more than hour then work for a few hours and stopped working no wifi very old plane service ok not good for business traveling
763,london to doha similar to our outbound flight the seats are comfortable but behind the competition very small storage area if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough the food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet though the taste was ok the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage
764,london heathrow to houston despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional they really seemed to be enjoying their work lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight commendably even in these days of austerity my pre lunch gin was served with fever tree tonic well done ba frequent drinks runs were made despite its age the jumbo was well turned out internally the only downside was because of air traffic issues at heathrow the flight arrived late this meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight this was mainly down to tardy immigration procedures the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight all very stressful
765,larnaca to london this a is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club having paid for my flight its disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than hours in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight if the person in front reclined their seat its a nightmare the seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing
766,i booked my ba flight from zurich to london heathrow using avios my frequent flyer number had to be added times during the booking process when i tried to reserve an aisle seat for medical reasons the ba website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which i would have had to pay about thirty pounds the checkin area for ba at zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport the checkin agent was very professional helpful and informative the area of departure from zurich was by transfer train the flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time i was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk german speaking sports fans one of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead in the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service the overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in german the flight arrived reasonably promptly
767,the booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book the cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare checkin was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well my gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty some of the to buy ms food items were not available and the lavatory i used was dirty the staff were very professional and pleasant and the dropdown route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy hardworking crew
768,london to tokyo narita had a fantastic flight in the new ba first cabin on the boeing on both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service the food was of high end restaurant standard the seat comfortable
769,bridgetown to london gatwick paid for a business class flight the onboard service was abysmal no refreshments offered on boarding dinner took three hours to be served on a night flight my husband had to go to the galley twice for his dinner requests hed been forgotten i requested express service which didnt happen website advertises premium levels of service and every journey unique and unforgettable the service was dreadful but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons dont waste your money with this airline you dont get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points and telling you that you dont pay for the service that the extra costs are for taxes the lounge and extra loyalty points all ba could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points really
770,st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article of ec stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights he then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed rightly or wrongly was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem what further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions never telling the passenger to raise their seat bas latest advert celebrates years of ba but for me their service is going backwards the music that accompanies the advert is called salvation and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it article of ec regulation is worth reading if this happens to you
771,chicago to london cancelled flights just a few hours before i left home then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight was finally put on a different flight on the way home because my first flight was through american airlines and the second through british airways all in the same booking i was only able to check in and get a seat on the american airlines flight as i was redirected every time to their website couldnt check in for the british airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable i always check in hours before to guarantee a seat but ba wouldnt allow me to do this
772,london to bangalore this was the worst experience i flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude i was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter i found the food portions so meagre not sufficient for a child also british airways is sad in every sense of the term
773,hamburg to abu dhabi via heathrow the h flight from hamburg to heathrow was like flying a budget carrier no free service at all everything has to be purchased at inflated prices heathrow t the usual chaos i can use the f lounge due to my one world status massive lounge crowded with the charm and food quality of a cafeteria toilets filthy one of the worst lounges ive seen boarding orderly and well organized boeing ife screen broken seats very uncomfortable and narrow service and food quality average flight abu dhabi to heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew this is something i have never experieinced before rest of the journey uneventful overall a rather disappointing experience ba cannot compete with the middle eastern carriers
774,london to seville following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with ba despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor i quickly called up ba to resolve the issue they understood the problem and gave me a full refund the agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem i dont believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning however its great to see ba treat their customers with care
775,doha to paris via london this is the first time using ba since october nothing has changed the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with ba and left them behind with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice it cannot compare with other business leaders like cathay and qatar airways but on this route ba charges the same price as qatar airways but delivers a much poorer product though the service was ok not as personal but alright where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of bags kgs each they are superior and generous i will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class
776,madrid to london ba on the couldnt have been a better service long time since i flew club europe but it was an amazing experience the welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food stephen one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience i have had in a long time well done to the crew on that flight
777,on the flight to tokyo i was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon thanks the return felt like a hour easyjet flight one meal and one half meal limited drinks very small seats im foot and my knees touched the seat in front very very mediocre
778,london to vancouver check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options very smooth process the disappointment was the receptionist at the galleries lounge at t who was rude and unhelpful all was redeemed once on board the crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best british airways tradition friendly helpful and attentive food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines wines better than many airlines the aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older ife selection good
779,the first class zone at heathrow t and the concorde lounge are very good service on board was excellent in both directions the cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home about the screen is small with poor resolution i enjoyed the flights in both directions mainly because of the service this first does not compare well with that of middle eastern and asian airlines but ba business class is so poor i either fly economy or when i am very lucky try to fly first
780,i had a miserable experience in first class from london to chicago i had requested a special meal but that was not available when i complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering k miles the bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones the angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest video screen is small and must be stowed away min before landing cabin crew never asked what i wanted and were only available when you press the call button in flight entertainment is poor
781,leeds bradford to las vegas via heathrow customer services handling of my question never answered it three times i asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over on the outbound flight this was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short lba lhr fare i asked why the fare was so much when i could have booked a seat for the bag for about the response was we are doing what everyone else is doing they never could explain why the fare increased by over when i indicated one checked bag i asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to book lhr las at that time and one bag included customer service apparently did not understand what i was asking because the answer provided was nonresponsive
782,dallas to london heathrow in first class this is the worst experience i have had on a flight the crew was indifferent and unresponsive and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them there was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines the attitude and service of the crew was abysmal when you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers this was nothing but a waste of money i doubt very much i will go back to british airways again
783,tenerife to heathrow effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service seats are rigid and i felt as if i was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight when i tried to put my seat back to recline i estimate it moved around degrees leg room is also non existent ms food ran out halfway through the hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons furthermore several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers ba again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals cant fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the ba brand they are professional friendly and courteous its clear that british airways are not the airline they once were and i hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory
784,heathrow to larnaca departed on time flight nearly full ms food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle larnaca to heathrow two messages received while in larnaca airport the flight would be delayed by over an hourdeparture was supposed to be at pm but we took off nearer to pm the second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us the flight was hours longso this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable worse than a budget airline a midnight arrival at heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a balance problem in addition i was incorrectly charged eur on the return leg for my case it was clearly the same case that i travlled out to cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers the only saving grace was the cabin crewparticularly the customer service managerwho promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint it will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout how british airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me
785,los angeles to london a very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the ba have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight if you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour only problem is the xx layout is one too many seats across as it leaves two very narrow gangways if you have an aisle seat in the turn right section in business class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally by economy section passengers with their carryons when boarding food and drinks were excellent with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone thanks also to two people most of us forget the flight crew who got us safely to heathrow minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived well done ba for providing such a good product and service
786,london to phoenix ba yesterday the plane was supposed to land at however it landed at because of this i missed my connecting flight to ontario california aboard american airlines by the time i was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage it was already the flight departs at i went to the ground crew of american airlines they told me that i will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway they then directed me to british airways i went to the ground attendant of british airways and she told me to go back to american airlines to get it re booked i went back to american airlines then they told me again to back to british airways since they are they the one who caused the delay i went back to british airways with the american airlines supervisor the british airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning she did not offer any explanations or anything american airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation i ended up getting my own car rental and drove from phoenix to california in the middle of the night since i was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines
787,san francisco to london after paying for flights which i had to cancel they wouldnt allow any change of dates or change of name and after all that wouldnt give me the avios points because i wont be on the flight
788,rome to london one of the best european airlines to travel with for short haul flights the online website is very clear and easy to use checkin procedure was smooth the gate was very close to the shopping area boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge the only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink as they dont serve anything free on all european routes
789,cologne to gatwick in economy class with an silver status ba card no online checkin available ba website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport hours before flight departure but airport checkin the only available option starts hours before departure no lounge available there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers except ba no priority boarding for business and elite level passengers boarding the plane by bus not even free water on board in economy
790,tampa to gatwick i paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when i got to the airport they wouldnt let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they cant do anything and i cant get on the plane they waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and wont reimburse me for the seats that i paid for but never received
791,london heathrow to madrid i travel from lhr regularly british airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality as a frequent traveler ive been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats this airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members the lounge at heathrow terminal is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments the bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available im very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend british airways keep it up guys
792,gatwick to st lucia return recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in caribbean for a th birthday celebration tickets bought in august and decided to spoil ourselves with a club class return having flown out premium economy arrived at airport to be told that wed been downgraded to premium economy due to overbooking apologetic ground staff defending the indefensible but no apology on the plane fuming all the way back to london exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service tea when i asked for coffee and filthy food complained on return through ba exec club webiste with response from customer service days later ba claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season we booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats ba has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder general quality of ba service food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years ba is now effectively a low cost airline flying a fleet of very tired aircraft trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline the accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet avoid this airline if you possible can and the final insult in booking premium seats with ba is that you get charge to pre reserve in club and in premium economy ba you are having a laugh with the flying public on this performance you dont deserve to stay in business
793,its been many years since i flew long haul british airways and i was pleasantly surprised by recent flights ba staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but thats all changed from the time of arriving at london heathrow t the staff have been really friendly and helpful similarly on the flight the attendants couldnt do enough for me when i requested tomato juice with worcester sauce the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it on the way back i asked for a tonic water and again they offered to go and get it the seating of these newer planes allows me knee room even though im ft ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too the entertainment system though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of cathay pacific nevertheless had a good range of movies and tv to watch both flights ended up arriving on time despite delays at heathrow both ways and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on food quality was reasonable again not up to the standard of cathay pacific rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which i thought was a bit mean overall a very pleasant flight thanks ba is this because competition is hotting up and ba now have to try harder
794,london heathrow pisa return my wife and i fly this route times a year as we have a home in tuscany sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price or we pay using avios this return trip was the latter it is what it is the most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world i have seen last minute flights on this route as high as return ba should be ashamed of themselves the only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions the seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit the new meals are quite good and the free is it really free booze the seats are the biggest con three seats for two with a dumb table in the middle unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster on the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad wine on the way back a ploughmans lunch it was okayish as a year old businessman one who has worked globally in my career in the us japan and the middle east and having sold my business a few years ago to one of the largest plcs in the country i think i know a bit about running companies i know i could do a lot better than the current board at ba last week when i was away i read that ba have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year oh what a surprise and thats the clear objective of the directors so what would i do with club europe id make it the best in europe the seat would be larger like an arm chair a configuration there would be a nice centre table charge ports for phoneslaptops headsets tv screens mainly for news but some movies for flights over hours extra of leg room behind row nice cutlery and glasschina ware hot meals and id probably sell it at a flight more build value guys and the profits will follow its the oldest dictum in the book i will give credit where credit is due on the way back on the ground the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk the length of plane asking if anyone had concerns or questions one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure very nice chap we took off hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine fas in both directions were very good
795,edinburgh to boston via london the planes are ancient and need to be replaced if these were cars they would have an antique plate the seats are uncomfortable and worn there is no lumbar support the space between the seatback in front and your face is inches its really claustrophobic the food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice so for each we had horrible seats and terrible food the short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water the ms menu is expensive and offers limited choices meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price the planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy the cabin crew on the bos to lhr and lhr to edi were good there was one member in the lhr to bos who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board british airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing
796,gatwick to mauritius my wife and friends booked and paid each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage on boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom my formal complaint to ba has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee we feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter trading standards are also being informed it didnt help the aircraft was delayed by hours on the outward leg was filthy dirty the return flight had numerous ife defects and my seat recline did not work i also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues i am a licensed engineer a marketing email in celebration of years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with ba and then rips me off with nothing in return british airways you are a disgrace get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for
797,flew out of heathrow on nd feb to new york mins into our flight and we noticed our tvs werent working travellers but i have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour the reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were the crew on this flight were amazing nothing was too much trouble thank you to all involved on that flight
798,horrible flight ba from gatwick to cape town and iberia on the return i am only st and i find the leg room too cramp the onboard flight entertainment system was down on the ba flight most of the time it was probably in the last hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop the food was barely edible coming back on iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad i was almost bumped off my connecting flight at mad due to the lockers being filled up i had another connection to make at lhr and i was not going to miss that so i had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off this was the worst flight i have flown on last long haul ba flight for me
799,new york to venice via london staff have been nice when around but aircraft food assistance and information all deplorable booked business class first flight overnight from jfk to heathrow quick mediocre food service then gone chair is set up so im staring at a stranger its uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions didnt wake me for breakfast not sure why they had me fill in a form for when i wanted to be woken up no instructions for the transition between ba flights now im on the flight from heathrow to venice no offer of coffee water but worse business class is just coach class no extra leg room just seats with the middle one blocked out person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest i didnt pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for long flights i wont fly ba again
800,chicago to london heathrow club class on british airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry it is bad enough that ba persist using out of date airplanes circa year old bs but they perpetuate the dreadful yingyang seating arrangement of club class where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you and raise a screen for privacy then midflight the crew lower the screen to serve the food to leave the seat one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passengerno mean feat in the dark the crew from chicago were appalling and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible breakfast was inedible and i returned it uneaten the lounge at ohare was a crowded tiny dirty facility with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese insufficient chairs and a single old tv does no one at ba care how bad they have become for premium class passengers
801,london to chicago could it get any worse the flight to chicago was equipped with the usual ancient boeing the british airways first class product doesnt come up to modern business class standards this particular flight was late again and the food wine was simply awful there is nothing remotely elegant about ba first class and the crew demonstrate no sophistication this experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain finally not only is the aircraft tired and worn out but the in flight socalled entertainment system did not work and had to be rebooted twice the first class seat is a bad joke and extraordinarily uncomfortable british airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire first class product all that can be said about this airline is woeful the concorde first class lounge at heathrow is filthy dirty and desperately needs refurbishment
802,prague to london heathrow very disappointing service cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin on a two hour flight that was already delayed payment machine was broken staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley on the bright said i did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices
803,london city to florence my flight was at around am in the morning not only it got canceled hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking on their site i had the option to reschedule my flight but i couldnt select any flights on the same day interestingly i was able to find book another one through skyscanner again with ba at the day of my initial flight with more of course why couldnt they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page
804,london to johannesburg since the aircraft was half full i was looking for a great flight we left on time and that was the only positive point i started watching a movie and a young flight attendant approached and asked for my dinner choice i told her that i would love a gt to start with and then i will read the menu she told me that this was a late evening departure pm is not late for me and that no predinner drinks would be served i insisted this is business class after all half full flight minutes later she brought a tray with everything on it gt first dish main dish and dessert never was i offered wine or coffee the lights were turned off and i did not see a flight attendant until hours before landing other passengers in business where treated the same and complained
805,doha to london heathrow flight on time not completely full had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane breakfast was served which was ok cabin crew mixed mostly young and worked quickly crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world there is good and bad still with ba bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival leathery and inedible why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering hardly any passengers near me could eat it bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved arrived on time at heathrow but to a remote stand
806,miami to tel aviv via london at miami airport on october what a pleasure was dealing with the agent so professional nice and helpful to the every last detail now on february calling british airways to redeem my avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient knowledgeable and nice agent she explained everything in such detail you are doing great with such fantastic employees
807,london to seoul i normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of club was prohibitive and so i thought i would give world traveller plus a go the cabin is stylish and intimate and i was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were the entertainment system was working well although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying i was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming my only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available a similar thing happened with breakfast three options the third being the most appetizing and no it hadnt been loaded so this is an area ba might want to look into all in all the service was good and worth the price for ground service ba please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work
808,london heathrow to new york jfk bag drop did not go well lounge galleries north was good and not crowded boarding was fine small delay well organised pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world weeks previous main meal good pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it on time arrival a good flight cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile i thought this was a good flight
809,san diego to london from the moment that i boarded this flight due to take off at the crew had one interest and one only to get the cabin lights off which they duly achieved two hours later as a consequence the service was negligent in the extreme this was a club world ticket so expensive and i looked forward to a decent level of service however i wasnt offered champagne on boarding wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal i complained to ba when i got home but they werent interested and i was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes this flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the us mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline
810,gatwick to st lucia flew ba new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up well lit cabin improved seating comfort better and operational entertainment system always hit or miss before and decent food cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant i have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at ba and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of todays experience i will consider them in the future much improved well done
811,london to chennai it was amazing the crew were very friendly the food was amazing and the seats were comfortable t was overall an amazing flight and i enjoyed it thoroughly
812,london to tampa ba broke my suitcase and i did not make a fuss i just got a new one the new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight the only suitcase i could purchase while abroad so on top of the new suitcase i had to actually pay ba to check the new bag cost me over for their mistake they also shovel off customer service to some company abroad you will get an email a month later saying id like to know you that we are unable to offer refund make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service
813,my husband and i flew on british airways flight ba from baltimore to london heathrow leaving on the th february every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer the plane was shabby and dated the seat reclining facility did not operate properly was not that comfortable and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines the touch screen tv monitor was not working properly one ear bud on the headphones did not work the audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the inflight entertainment which in itself had a dated choice the pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover the air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air the restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied however what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew they were abrupt unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there there was one exception an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight there did not appear to be any organisation or smooth coordination when distributing the meals our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member this flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight there was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed unlike all the other airlines that i have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or reassure them british airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and i would only fly with them again if there was no other option
814,bridgetown to gatwick i couldnt imagine that first class on ba would be the same as travelling in business class with for example qatar emirates etihad singapore thai etc for double the price cabin seats and food equals business class one of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when i left london outbound cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service but first class on ba is not worth the fare when i complained to customer service after i got home all i got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller
815,london to athens classic ba love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster problems in december at heathrow checkin when ba checkin and baggage management it systems went down for at least minutes total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving minutes prior to their departure and given priority even though we were checked in at some point the flight was delayed by hours on top of the problems then flight does not have enough food onboard at least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum
816,i booked a british airways flight from amsterdam to london heathrow in the beginning everything went normal and smooth checkin and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another first an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in heathrow fair enough afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage after that we received a rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at schiphol airport and they are doing their best to resolve it this caused us already about mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started we received permission to take off after mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and i guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave the crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave so a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off then the pilot announced that we can take off after or hours the flight was full of overseas travellers we spent hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere people unboarded the plane times in total and no food or water was offered to us we had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it the overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in london
817,flying premium economy on british airways from new orleans to london was an absolute pleasure the nine hour flight was an amazing experience with great legroom reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again
818,tokyo to london i was looking forward to this flight because of the club world ticket and because it was my first time flying on a boeing we had a good checkin experience breezed through the airport and enjoyed the jal lounge at narita we boarded on time and first impressions of the boeing were good a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded the food and wines were really good i had a beautifullypresented japanese starter followed by a bentostyle lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options there was plenty of choice on the ife and there was a big screen on the downside the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight this was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too the seat was comfortable and reclined fully but i find the layout of ba club world a little awkward because you have to step over another passengers footrest to access the aisle the cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming the context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to tokyo we had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew we both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight
819,london to tokyo haneda my wife and i treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to japan with the help of my avios and a ba amex companion voucher we were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated checkin area at heathrow was great we boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint we had very grand seats with lovely surroundings the cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted the food and alcoholic drinks were great i went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding i was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the ife my wife and i both said afterwards that it didnt feel like a longhaul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably my only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep
820,i was flying london to billund today via british airways and i was a bit hesitant as ive never flown with this airline due to early morning traffic i was running a little behind schedule and i had a kg bag to also check in and check in closed mins before my flight departs upon arrival i was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful he calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay as i was very very stressed thinking i was going to miss my flight he then offered to give me fast track through security so i could get to my gate quicker i just want to thank him again as he made my experience with british airways like no other and im very grateful
821,san diego to frankfurt via london it all started when trying to check in online h before departure from san diego to heathrow on long flights like this i always reserve an aisle seat online checkin did not work no reason was given ok lets call us hotline i tried at least times answers were either that call could not be completed check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now i did not make it through as an act of desperation i today called a british number the lady told me guess what no more aisle seats available some other numbers i tried were available on weekdays only good to know if you need help on a sunday so ive got the strong feeling that they do not even care about there customers b on my flight to san diego days ago my tv screen was gone and there was no way to change seats great overall experience
822,flown with british airways on numerous occasions with no issues however on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at gatwick there was no british airways representative at the baggage claim however there was a phone that allowed me to call the baggage department reclaiming lost baggage was simple and my bag was put on the next flight to singapore which i received the following day
823,flying last sunday from geneva to piladelphia via london in business class when i arrived at the boarding gate in london to take my flight to philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available they overbooked my choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight they just did not care about their customer no phone call no email no indication at the lounge nothing until i was at the boarding gate i kindly accepted to take the next flight the plane was delayed by hour due to technical issues when i arrived at philadelphia no suitcase no british airways desk on arrival it was late no one could help i finally retrieve my suitcase days later broken during these days it was impossible to get someone on the phone on my flight back to geneva same issue no sufficient business class seats available it is clear that this company just dont care about their customers they just care about their money 
824,london heathrow to paris cdg quick and easy flight to paris took just minutes to reach cdg everything went well and the cabin was very clean the only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized
825,johannesburg to london at johannesburg used ba galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy plane boarded on time very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit given aircraft at jnb all day perhaps this could have been addressed after take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal portions of starter very small i was given someone elses by mistake which was then taken away and given to him i thought that originally the idea of the new club world meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that main was good beef dessert was cheese very small basic selection then bed gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable breakfast was ok delay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue there seemed to be a few of these arrivals lounge was good overall an average experience
826,edinburgh to bangalore via heathrow rude staff poor service missing baggage poor entertainment system i spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal i apologised for my clumsiness but i was made to feel like i had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me i asked for tissues and the answer was get it from the toilet the staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if i needed another drink once i cleaned myself up the crew were also extremely noisy chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration and then while boarding at edinburgh they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full the staff wrote bangalore via heathrow but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight hours gap mind you
827,berlin to johannesburg via london the short haul flight between berlin and london was okay they dont include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some lowcost carriers high because of an engine problem the flights from lhr to jnb was delayed by h british airways gave vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks inside the a the ife boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space
828,new york jfk to london heathrow with british airways an extremely average flight nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as bad the flight was smooth and felt quite short the cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable the inflight entertainment needed some work
829,ive always favoured british airways and will always try and choose to fly with them which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel i have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early checkin and onflight catering for economy however ba have stripped both the above perks i now struggle to see the value and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of easyjet yet you pay almost double then today i flew back from denmark with sas and it was amazing and made ba look cheap not only do you get a good meal on board you get free drink can charge your electronics and get wifi for only euros outstanding
830,new york to london via geneva with british airways the plane was late not an issue but some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudly on a hour flight they served us the food mins after departure then mins at the most after started clearing we were not even close to finish eating then mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to this was really poor service especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us thats what you call bad customer service ps i was charged for a luggage after buying my ticket 
831,a boarding is always a nightmare but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed showup by the pilots fortunately we still managed to take off more or less on time the cabin crew responsible for our side of the first cabin was personable but lacked experience the food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience the seats in first are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors premium cabin the duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin one of the first toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the club world loos upstairs it would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience but no comment was made the ife was passable and the sound quality good if ones own noise cancelling headphones are used wifi was available but i didnt make use of it breakfast was unremarkable and i wish bread rather than pastries was offered deplaning was delayed by halfanhour because of early morning congestion at t and the lack of a stand overall a reasonable flight but not first class
832,the seating in the front section of club world on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than but its showing its age in contrast to other carriers a full cabin also means queues for the two loos although theyre a lot more spacious than in first the drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours but the revamped club world food is definitely an improvement the fish option for the main course was some of the best food ive had in the air the white company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats cabin crew were generally good and the csm was particularly visible during the flight breakfast was improved with the option to preselect items arrival was ahead of schedule
833,london to johannesburg smooth check in via club world desks fast track security was fast and got to lounge quickly lounge was ok food a little better and staff seemed more attentive we were able to use the spa which was nice showers were fine with no queues flight left on time my first experience of the new club world catering which seemed to go well slept for hours lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older s which as my son says have a gap between stool and seat sometimes crew on this sector were good and the fa serving our area was experienced and it showed the csd seemed to go through the motions only arrival fine and baggage was first on belt a good flight
834,ba on jan excellent short flight from heathrow to dublin in club europe cabin crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent the club europe catering was excellent i had preordered a glutenfree meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with glutenfree bread the main course was beef ratatouille with a doco dessert pot this was the best inflight meal ive had on a short haul flight on arrival in dublin the ground service from swissport was poor it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer minutes for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal
835,whatever happened to the worlds favourite airline returning from bermuda to gatwick we were presented with a wornout boeing my seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off i had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat it didnt work tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me ill put it in the book no apology no attempt to explain just irritation from him the food was awful neither my wife or i could finish it it also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits and nothing to go on the salad my wifes entertainment screen didnt work the passenger next to me screen didnt work and mine only worked intermittently it look liked something from the arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible i believe the s out of gatwick are being updated cant come a moment too soon we purchased premium economy tickets for the this flight we didnt get a premium service initially i was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so im glad i didnt my frustration with ba grows every year we only fly with them now when we have too
836,kuala lumpur to miami via london in business class with british airways the business class seats were small for business class and pretty old the flight entertainment system are outdated i am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selection food choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class overall ba have to do better to be on top of their game planes has to be changed
837,zurich to heathrow last year they started boarding flights by groups a week or two after the free beverages and snack service disappeared and the final nail in the coffin was pay to choose seating i decided no ba anymore i moved away from ba the only issue i have that now i have to maintain frequent flyer status with two or three separate airlines the last flight i took ba to use my avios points and i literally flew free but never to use ba again
838,miami to london the breakfast served just before landing was terrible a terrible croissant with some cream cheese with onions and a breakfast fruit bar it was wrapped in cellophane hardly anyone ate it what a waste
839,copenhagen to amsterdam via london heathrow with british airways there was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flight but the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and i enjoyed the flight the seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh during the second flight from lhr to ams the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand like how the taxi from polderban is almost as long as the flight itself
840,antigua to gatwick apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus we checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only seats for the of us remained unbooked we had to take seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats and on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets only loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us cabin pressure was uncomfortably low overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds tatty seat covers broken foot rest malfunctioning entertainment broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees when asked for help the stewardess told us she didnt have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue
841,i understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as boac go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible i paid to fly rt laxbuh and yet they want an extra to have a desirable seat i understand if you checkin hours before departure you receive a seat from those available but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there in my case they assigned me a middle seat on a when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign it is baffling the ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make everything comes down to make every penny they can and why am i flying boac they owed me from the last flight bc the inflight entertainment system was inop for the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelvehour flight on top of that their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that for normalsized adults it is as agonising as the rack mustve been and of course you only get compensation by patronising them again now i know ever a free ticket on boac is overpriced
842,london to miami worst long haul business class that annoying divider the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats the service is nonexistent unless they are serving you the meal if you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member they dont ask you if you need anything between meals the toilets are dirty and basic im a gold member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines theyve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and its not like theyre cheap
843,i used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy they get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne the staff were well turned out but rushed as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew a hot meal was served an hour after take off which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables chocolate mousse and biscuits cheese quality red and white wine was served the inflight movie selection was ok a light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee tea getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports not my best flight
844,boarding was fairly quick the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and bags stored i was lucky that no one was sitting next me so i had some more room the pre take off drink was water or orange juice within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef salad was served with a good dessert wine selection was very american with jug wines the movie selection was ok the pe seats are more comfortable than economy the extra inches of width make a huge difference the nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies
845,bangalore to london ground experience not great at lhr automated bag drop didnt work and it wasnt clear why slowtoreact assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to india needed to be validated at blr no online checkin available and slow process plane decor extremely run down and shabby various pieces of the interior trim bulkheads etc rattling and latches for bassinet shelves not locking row so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided seat itself could have more width i kept bumping the vod control and im quite slim recline limited and footrest could extend more no usb power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age vod itself is atrocious tiny screen folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats low resolution visible gridlines and very little choice hardly the latest movies to top it off on outbound leg the vod stopped working altogether and resisted many resets customer service forms were handed out so i await the outcome of that food volume ok quality poor scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg insufficient lavatories for premium economy and economy
846,barcelona to new york via london i was in barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check my flight from barcelona to london was delayed causing passengers to miss their connections when i finally got a flight we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly it took me nearly hours to travel from barcelona to jfk when i arrived my luggage wasnt there so i filed a claim i called and emailed every day and they couldnt find it even though i had a tag number and and documentation eight days later they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery the final insult is that i was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days as a result they have offered me no compensation for damages
847,gatwick to fort lauderdale charging to choose seats even within h prior take off is outrageous so if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges
848,we recently flew from london to bologna the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space so we did when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys so i approached the damagedlost baggage area lodged a claim and provided all the evidence explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap i was advised by the representatives to ring ba service line made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim well it is still going despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded they instead asked me to produce receipts from years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused to refund
849,venice to london city really we had a great experience with british airways we enjoyed very much flying with british airways lovely staff and great service
850,san francisco to london terrible service and food cramped uncomfortable seats and terrible entertainment in one of my flights it wasnt working the crew couldnt care less i will not fly with them again 
851,heathrow to vancouver the seats booked not given took months to respond to a complaint after submitting multiple messages to them for an update a dirty plane fantastic front line staff i would never fly ba again
852,london to bucharest first class ground staff but in the air its quite a disappointment the basic economy seats have so little cushion it is agony to sit for longer than in them and for a can of cocacola
853,i forgot i had purchased a hand baggage only fare at the airport i was charged more than euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost the staff at checkin could not have been less helpful the whole experience was of a bad lowcost airline boarding process saw me in category having to board last not so much as a glass of water is offered the seats have very little legroom and just one toilet for the a economy cabin
854,when the passenger in front reclines hisher seat it makes it very difficult to get in and out of ones seat as the arm rests do not go all the way up the middlewindow seat passengers have to climb over there is little leg room and no leg rest the boeing ife screen is smaller than the ones on the british airways s and could do with an upgrade the saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew
855,boston to london world traveler seats nice headrest legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines hisher seat the seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read british airways magazine or even use my ipad we ordered special meals halal and low sodium the muslim meal chicken tikka masala with naan was restaurant quality flavorful and not spicy hot the gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like moms the low sodium meal herb roasted chicken tomato rice petite broccoli diced red pepper and carrots was delicious dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries the ife was very good bright and clear led screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages
856,london to athens we were fortunate to get exit row seats in advance they were spacious with plenty of legroom they had more width than the cramped boeing that we had just flown in on we each had a carry on however during the transit process british airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags i have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags bare bones service no meals which is okay no complimentary soft drinks or water bottled water was available for purchase in hindsight we would have been better off flying on aegean airlines
857,london to johannesburg so impressed by the lady that checked us in something went wrong with my booking i was supposed to fly at with my boyfriend back home to south africa after our visit in uk but somehow my ticket was booked at we didnt even notice that until she had brought it up at the checkin i was so shocked by the fact that i would be traveling all by myself its my first trip overseas she was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of minute we obviously thought that we would not be able to sit next to each other with grateful hearts we were checking in our bags when she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft how awesome is that thank you british airways and their helpful staff
858,newark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy world traveler plus i paid about more for premium economy about extra so approximately per leg was it worth it id say broadly yes though i wouldnt want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of hours was involved before boarding premium economy does get a standard checked bag allowance whereas economy is bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow and india to uscanada is one of those exceptions though it isnt clear if it applies for travel originating at either end so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the bag allowance boarding you board in zone after firstbusiness the oneworld elites that is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage if it doesnt fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding this means you also get off fairly quickly which can help if youre in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination in flight there is a welcome drink for premium economy champagne juice water depending on the departure time there is also a hot towel service also cabin the has a nicely done premium economy cabin seating as opposed to in economy so a somewhat wider seat seat pitch is also decent these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats but seat was comfortable the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage though not much there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades socks and toothpaste the seat back screen is large and easy to use there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy so not a long walk cabin has a seating in premium economy same as club world as opposed to in economy the version used on the lhrblr sector has a very small premium economy cabin just rows of seats this gives it a sort of cosy feel you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the but premium economy was not full and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs that helped me stretch out for sure the seat back screen on the old is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer seats food nothing much here i didnt think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been it was ok nothing to write home about all in all for such a long journey the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage worth it on extra long haul like us to india bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs
859,london to berlin scheduled for st december on approach to the airport i got a message saying that my flight was canceled no explanation was given as i arrived at the airport staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues and if i wanted to travel in the next days ahead of christmas i should book my own travel with another airline or train company eg eurostar my costs would be reimbursed the airport staff also said no further help from british airways is available on the day to due airport issues i felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty gbp fare for a short haul flight for the next day as it was christmas prices were very high after i arrived at my destination a lengthy exchange of messages with british airways started and british airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation
860,london to mumbai i have had my battles with the leadership at ba because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their airmiles now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn airmiles through their credit cards this is just to illustrate that i boarded ba with a slightly negative mindset a mindset which was changed quickly although i travelled economy the seat was comfortable the service excellent as was the food if i have a minor quibble the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old is this bas attempt to reduce costs because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product i was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any singleuse plastic eg water bottles dutyfree carrier bags into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine having been grumpy about several aspects of bas service in the past i will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements
861,athens to los angeles via london worst flight experience i had a ticket from october travelling st december hrs they decide to cancel the flight and give me the alternative for another flight hrs later athens to los angeles via london same day when arrive at london i realize from the announcement screen that my flight was operated after i heard the announcement last call before departure i checked at the ba information desk and confirm my flight the one was cancelled i asked them and reply we found aircraft hrs before and rescheduled flight i send email and i had same response twice flight never operated or rescheduled i think they had overbooked flight and didnt care about it
862,our return journey from sydney to london which was approximately hours in duration with a stop at singapore airport was faced with one major issue we flew economy class with a two year old whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasnt working having paid for our two year olds ticket you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed we were offered to move seats to the only seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical the cabin crew gave us some first class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was they said they would contact ba customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us by the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim i had already received an email from ba cs and that they would respond within hours which they did however all the could offered was a voucher to use on another ba flight i replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said i also said i had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an evoucher is worthless to me there was no other alternative or any means of reasoning the flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable ba also offer wifi on the plane but when you try to use it they charge per hour in economy class
863,i had flown british airways from leeds bradford to london heathrow as a part of my journey back home thailand on the th december i arrived at leeds bradford hours early so there wasnt a queue at the checkin counter checkin process took less than a minute as i already done online checkin this means i just dropped my luggage the staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful i passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft boarding process is a mess as there wasnt priority boarding i flew economy and no boarding groups luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door as the aircraft parked on a remote stand the aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean the seat was comfortable and had a good wing view the only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short luckily i was only m tall so this wasnt a problem the aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition but the crew were very friendly and very helpful the captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information as the flight departed the crew started on board service i didnt buy anything as the food option was poor expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards it was one hour flight so i didnt expect the top service standard the flight arrived at london heathrow on time despite some traffic overall the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better
864,gatwick to tenerife this aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring gmedk is by far the most uncomfortable plane i have ever been on i paid extra for an extra leg room seat a because i always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight i reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal it was like sitting on concrete i would imagine that when this aircraft was new i believe the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding it was dreadful i took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in lanzarote which coupled with there being no passengers next to me made the flight in f a little more bearable staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time i returned at night ten days later i normally travel easyjet on this route but on this occasion i used some avios to make the flight less expensive easyjet offer two trolley runs but only on these ba flights with their diminishing attitude to customer welfare i will not use ba on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by easyjet is in my experience far superior
865,booked a flight through expedia for june from denver to paris via london on the promise that i could upgrade using avios after booking the flight and trying to upgrade was notified that i could not upgrade the flight due to how i purchased the ticket paid about for early seat selection on both flights after buy up to the front of the plane was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation but found out they gave the seats that i paid extra for to another party could request a refund but wouldnt honor what they had sold me in the first place they would not honor a refund either then i became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of plus paid for upgrades
866,johannesburg to london i had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck the only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night ba has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last years and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them the business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat the difference is that it goes to a full bed there is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table as it was a late flight pm the crew decided not to offer predinner drinks i ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep big mistake you only get the appetiser tiny and the desert even smaller i was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew the trays are removed when everyone else finishes so much for getting more sleep the crew never came back until breakfast that flight was a total disappointment
867,london to kuala lumpur this is my first time flying with ba to kuala lumpur on the dreamliner was very excited for this trip as ba has made a come back to fly to malaysia after stopping the service for many years i paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room i absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice i made a complaint to the crew that my seat b has sunk and i felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next hours crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it which didnt help either the tv screen on b was also not working and i didnt watch anything during the whole duration of the flight i would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time this will be my last time flying with ba unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the a i am dreading on my next return flight back to london crews were friendly and helpful no fault with that
868,los angeles to london heathrow very poor customer service i checked in hours prior to my flight departure asked can i have aisle seat and she just said no i asked her why and she replied that they dont have any in the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we dont have space and you can put that underneath your seat they served dinner and said we dont have any more chicken so you can have pasta i told him i dont like pasta and do you have any vegetarian food he said the pasta is vegetarian
869,our flight from seattle to london in november th was canceled due to technical problems after waiting at the airport for hours and staying in the line for hours the ba associate couldnt find us any immediate flight they offered us a flight that would arrive in london late november th it would take us hours since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in november i would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive my trip was supposed to be days so by the time of arrival i had to return in less than two days they advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking i filed a claim online based on their instruction the customer relation phone number is disconnected in fact the automatic voice mail says please dont chase a call the website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist after months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them
870,gatwick to barbados we flew out of gatwick on the th december and back on the th dec it started well in the newish st class lounge at the south terminal however the walk to the gate is miles it has to be almost mile walk which is a joke to be honest the north terminal where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight the decor and layout is much much better id guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the st my first impression was how badly the new st class is holding up there are scuff marks everywhere surface scratches bobbles of wear on the seat fabric its probably under years of use but looks more like in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains needs a paint job at least the motley flowers that ba removed some years ago to save costs but reinstated are there they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard much has been said about the seat being an up market business class and this is true it is not a true st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer i have flown both in st the food is also business class quality more casual dining rather than fine dining taking one meal it starts with an amuse bouche one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese one tomato one bit of green stuff one straggly piece of prosciutto ham total cost about p outstanding i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan totally utterly boring my wife had the soup which she said was nice i then had jerk chicken dish it was just about okay the glassware and chinaware was okay the cutlery was poor quality the stuff youd expect in pizza express except the stuff in pizza express is better i accept we are stuck with this st product for the next years or so but there is so much ba could do to improve the cheap look of their premium product quality of presentation food champagne even the menu covers they trumpet the superb laurent perrier grand siecle champagne which retails at a bottle its nice but we all know this is inferior to what most airline st class offer in krug a bottle more the alternative to st is of course the ghastly yingyang club business class the worlds most hated business class in the sky im a businessman and i know i could run this airline better from a quality perspective from a price perspective if you bundle a st flight as part of a ba holiday it sort of works out okayish the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women
871,moscow to london fantastic first class service the moscow lounge was surprisingly good with excellent runway views quick boarding and i was escorted to my seat by the crew the new first seats on the fleet are a real upgrade from the older product theres plenty of space a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space the inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic the best airline meal ive had drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival the crew were very attentive and friendly with it a fantastic experience and ill look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin
872,johannesburg to london for supper i asked for warm hot water to make milky drink as i dont drink tea or coffee for health reasons given with no problems for breakfast i requested the same and i was refused i explained i dont drink tea or coffee but milk and water we dont keep hot water i can get it once we have finished serving all other customers that never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger i kept my sugar milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water explaining i have been waiting he said he will bring it in seconds and he never came back i felt like a nuisance deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing
873,bridgetown to gatwick booked our return flight in businessclub class at each only to find ba want to charge an extra each to choose our seats awful seating with their yingyang seating arranged like sardines in a tin poor cabin staff attitude i asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told we only do that in first class if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that i was almost asleep when i was disturbed by fooddrinks being passed through the serving hatch otherwise known as a privacy screen to the inner seat this happened times a sort of sleep deprivation torture if you are expecting business class levels of service and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed
874,glasgow to new york via london morning flight from gla to lhr was ok i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk on the jfk flight the service was fantastic the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight we left and arrived on time the seat and legroom was fine my mothers ife didnt work and she was moved seat which she appreciated the cabin crew were very friendly
875,sydney to london via singapore im hugely disappointed with the business class trip the seating arrangements leave little to be desired ie if you are on the isle youre interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you refer to seat guru for more understanding service is slow and once you have your food good luck getting rid of your tray for about minutes if youre next to the window you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat the drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive if you do get a drink be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray i had two drinks slip off the teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat dont get me started with the inflight entertainment or the lack of it after i watched two movies on a hour flight i was scratching to find anything else decent to watch the new releases is a contradiction in terms there is very little priority giving to business class when boarding the plane sure you re called first but because of the planes configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats i would not recommend ba to anyone
876,johannesburg to london in contrast to our excellent outbound experience inbound lacked the wow factor the cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding the dinner service was unremarkable too and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights my ife touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month sleep quality was reasonable although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant breakfast was pretty good arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic comair flight
877,antigua to gatwick one of the worst business class experience entertainment system didnt work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution service super slow crew to serve business class passengers food bad beef over cooked mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed woke up min before landing and offered a yogurt
878,gatwick to barbados first class was third rate a disgusting cabin crumbs on the seat dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls it looked as though it hadnt been properly cleaned for days poor service and an entertainment system from a different age i have avoided flying with ba for the last years now i remember why avoid them if your route allows
879,cape town to london very unimpressive amenities and service unless you have a bulkhead seat there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carryon baggage except in the bin above the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get my husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldnt get the attention of steward to rectify i gave him one of the two sets on mine i on the other hand never got the main course i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and overcooked
880,bucharest to london they are not giving free food and drinks anymore you have to pay on short haul in bucharest they did not park at the terminal they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus they are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because the flights are too busy avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to i have no problem with ba turning into a budget airline but at least charge accordingly otherwise it feels like were being scammed
881,kuala lumpur to mexico city via london the journey from malaysia to mexico alone for business trip would be very boring however during my trip from london to mexico city on dec it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me especially associated with muslim needs on food they are polite and talk to me with big smiles so when i returned back to malaysia and transit in london from mexico city on dec i wished i will be able to meet them again hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip
882,miami to london ba are going downhill having been offered chicken curry of vegetable pasta on the outward journey the choice was exactly the same this time i explained to the steward that i didnt like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but i was told by an extremely rude steward that i could like it or lump it basically he said i should have put my requests on my account but you cant account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldnt expect them only to have two menus the snack before landing was the most disgusting bagelbun totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff making a bad situation worse the light didnt work on my seat so i couldnt read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my tv watching was incredibly hard entertainment having travelled four times in last month films have barely changed i wont be travelling with them again if at all possible
883,i would like to compliment british airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight service from the crew and the food served before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company overall a very enjoyable flight from london gatwick to tampa
884,arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours during this time no clear information was available from the checkin desk who were unable to confirm the delay or elsewhere at the airport over an hour after the flight should have taken off and after most people had purchased refreshments an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so no complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay we landed at gatwick minutes before the last train left meaning we then had to shell out for a taxi home despite this ba refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours hours minutes to be exact and took over a month to respond to my request about it this airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements bas transformation into an overpriced easyjet will not fly with them again
885,we have been loyal customers with british airways since i was a little girl every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in italy on october th i booked airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving october st coming back november th as my grandfather was very sick and didnt have much longer to live on october th my grandfather passed away we put in a cancellationrefund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time as british airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us of our seats even though we never used their services this has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather in addition every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience ive ever encountered i am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor i will fly with them in the future
886,gatwick to las vegas boarding by group number seemed to work well at gatwick we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about min after take off the crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team ba have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best ive ever had on a long haul flight the aircraft was old and dated and the ife was a throwback to the s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to hd quality these days all in all a very enjoyable flight
887,nassau to london premium economy on ba is a joke highlighted by my friday morning am breakfast a glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold sealed in plastic croissant and an equally sealed banana breadcake no hot fooddrink awful that after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen a screen no larger than in economy the only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area the extra leg room was about ok but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a lb male yes large but not obese ba premium economy forget it other airlines do this better
888,phoenix to accra via london i had a great customer service treatment at the check in at phoenix by the young lady who checked me in she was very professional and handled my check in process excellently my entire trip was great and i really was treated very well also on my final leg to accra by the ba staff in london as well just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff
889,manchester to london the bag drop process took an hour even though i had checked in already the staff offered little apology explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this staff on the flight were clumsy and rude one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology another flight attendant didnt bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments not exactly best of british and ill certainly not be recommending
890,san diego to hannover via london i booked on bacom the longer flights both ways in premium economy on the return i was informed at san diego that the american airlines flight into dfw was severely delayed and i would miss my flight into london american airlines could book me on a later flight the same day but had only coach available if i insisted on premier economy i could fly in days i took the coach and american assured my that ba would refund the fare difference for this downgrade after arrival at home i contacted ba on their website to refund the fare difference a bizarre exchange followed first they said you did not buy any upgraded seat i told them to look at the ticket you cant get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat i contacted ba germany who said you get a refund but you booked this with a travel agent so we are not in charge i booked with ba on their website they saidthey would send this to london so they can compute the refund but then you cant get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance the change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed american airlines flight this is miserable customer service
891,london heathrow to stuttgart absolutely disgusted with ba my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed ba had one job to do put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in stuttgart this has proven too difficult the bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support
892,london to johannesburg turning right to the first wing at t was a new experience for us it was all pretty slick although the guy at checkin wasnt exactly mr convivial the concorde room was impressive too particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design overlooking the main concourse boarding involved lining up according to group this smacked a bit of lowcost airlines but i guess thats necessary with all the passengers on a doubledecker plane the first cabin on the a is definitely more spacious than on a and the suites also had more room and extra storage space the dividers seemed higher too giving better privacy the fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus cabin crew were friendly attentive and thoroughly professional food was good too and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly the wines on offer were a good selection including the fabulous lpgs and we enjoyed some wine tasting sleep quality was considerably better than club world although the cabin temperature was a little high overall an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel
893,having booked ba business class and paid extra for the seat selection on the boeing i was disappointed to have the flight rescheduled i rejected bas offer of flying on belgian air and had to change my flight to get a different ba aircraft when i booked in the window seat selections had been lost my husband and i were forced to sit separately at the booking in i was told that they could not find proof that i had paid for selected seats i could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip i planned on the return flight again sitting apart from my husband my tv did not work the staff could not have been nicer but could not find an alternative seat on return ba customer complaints offered a voucher on my next flight despite sending two detailed messages i received the same response completely inadequate service by ba not the flight attendants in delivering the flights i paid for and dealing with the complaints
894,vancouver to london heathrow i chose to fly with them because i had been told they were good for families and as i was traveling with my month old alone this was what i needed the booking process was not smooth and very stressful i have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center the flights were great though the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure i was doing ok the crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok i was first given a cot for my baby i originally wanted a one of the britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot nope he was too big and could not lie straight so i asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with minutes all the toilets in economy were out of order at least hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets im sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant
895,boston to nairobi via london the only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from boston to heathrow the cabin crew service was below standard i had a window seat and twice i was passed up and not offered anything to eatdrink while everyone around me was simply because i was watching a movie i noticed that if you didnt have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything airplane food is not exactly gourmet but ba food was so bland even the little i ate was only because i was hungry the connecting flight from heathrow to nairobi was worse because the plane was the opposite of the one from boston to heathrow it looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a usb port cabin crew service on this leg was below standard im probably to blame because i overrated ba before flying with them but now i know better
896,basel to san fransisco via heathrow im convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years i booked world traveller plus or premium economy which costs appr twice as much as economy the flight to sfo was ok seat wise as the plane was an a and i has reserved an aisle seat the food was disgusting for me during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza the choice of food leaves a lot to be desired there were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed we were offered maybe two hot drinks during the hours on the plane longer due to a delay leaving the uk the flight back to the uk was worse since it was a boeing with the older bulkier seats you couldnt even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and im not big the recliner didnt work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat i feel sorry for larger people the food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks the staff seem challenged with certain situations next time im off to the us i will look for an alternative airline
897,london to lyon the flight has h delay for a flight duration of ground staff forced me to checkin my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and i got my suitcase damaged with big cuts on the back then the customer service has been very useless such a very bad experience i do not recommend flying with them
898,london to boston i was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat the flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured i was comfortable throughout the flight superb customer service
899,stockholm to london standard configuration on short haul european flights business class still seats each side of the isle middle seat fitted with a tray had a wonderful crew with super professional stewards in business drinks served with a smile and the food also food reminding of what was served in economy years ago when there still was free there the best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding
900,amsterdam to london arrived minutes late three delays taking off landing and getting the walkway to the airplane this has happened twice this year i fly klm of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely i fly british on this route when it is significantly cheaper but am delayed im sure its bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day
901,buenos aires to london we flew overnight friday th november the plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable there were large numbers or argentinian passengers on the plane yet i saw no staff that spoke spanish the chicken dinner was described as curry but there was no sauce on it the bread roll was stale and dessert stodgy during the night no water was offered to me it was not possible to charge electronic equipment the seatback screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment
902,business class space is ridiculously narrow service is very careless you are not allowed laptops on the flight from riyadh so you cannot work if you want to you cannot choose when to eat
903,aberdeen to heathrow to connect to a flight in gatwick the day after during checkin using the ba app there was a problem that i had to restart after that when i opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold after calling ba and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay at the airport desk what a rip off for a short flight by curiosity i checked with easyjet and if i had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money ba asked for the bag
904,i would not recommend this airline i travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to baggage allowance only give you kgs of checked baggage and if you are kg over regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under you have to pay aud extra this is the strictest airline i have ever used all other airlines have allowed up to kgs over at no charge ensure you have preweighed all bags inflight meal on the way to sydney they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal it is an hour flight make sure you pack your own snacksmeal you dont get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks make sure you prepack a bottle or two once you are through customs customer service from the get go the customer service was appalling it is hard enough traveling with kids but having to deal with ba was stressful they wouldnt allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and i had a slight delay which meant i couldnt go on the same flight at the airport they couldnt find my childrens booking which caused further delay and stress how do you misplace kids on the same booking they then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldnt do anything to help change this we had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own dont bother flying ba
905,new york to budapest via london the second flight was a bit different the plane was clean but cold i wanted to drink water but the cabin crew does not accepted my request by mistake the captain welcomed the passengers to bucharest and not budapest
906,heathrow to athens on a arrived at the airport in time and bag drop was an ease got to the gate within mins of bag drop with light security queues on the aircraft there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat f a funny safety video played and the flight was smooth no food was served except some ms bbc news was playing on the screens with no sound and russian captions quite confusing the plane landed half an hour late but it was the best landing i have ever experienced
907,london to bangkok i am not a fan if the ba configuration in business however i did have seat j so it was right up front i am not sure where to begin food awful i ordered beef a showcase of british beef the notes said that was inedible i left most of it instead of asking was something wrong or would i like another meal option the fa took the tray away and asked if i wanted dessert wine reds whites and champagnes hardly a stellar wine list entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options staff challenged at best clearly some had not been in business before disengaged and disinterested the cabin was over hill for me the toilet was not checked very often a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin i would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations
908,abu dhabi to london although a ba flight this sector was operated by air belgium and offered a really poor experience aircraft felt old and tired cabin crew were totally indifferent cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible a really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future
909,gatwick to orlando stains on the seat cotton buds in the seat well disgusting and had to force them to clean no entertainment on board it was not functional internet available at three times emirates price and twice aa flight and speed that wont achieve streaming when i complained to ba they told me i couldnt communicate with the ceo but i could connect with their customer relations i have been gold on ba for thirty years and its time to ditch this non responsive airline
910,newcastle to las vegas via london both my flights were great on time and the food was good on the flight to london and a nice bottle of champagne as well my long haul flight was also good aircraft was yrs old but clean cabin crew were very nice friendly and efficient my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic the only complaint i can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved ie try showing some classic british comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of apart from that absolutely great well recommended
911,while it is still fresh in my mind id like to commend the hard working crew of my ba flight from stpetersburg to london heathrow on rd october the checkin staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner the cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too the cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early the captain was informative my only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the ms buy on board option was a bit tedious disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way this flight has restored my faith in ba well done to the superb crew
912,london to philadelphia i upgraded from coach to business for almost because i wanted to experience bas business class in the boeing but i was disappointed while the aircraft was new the staff really could have cared less about the business guests in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail ba lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite service wise was lacking preflight they offer you a beverage i asked for rose champagne and i was told i guess i have to go find a bottle and open one in my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every hours not on this almost hour flight i was served my main meal almost hours after takeoff you get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing you also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is hours before landing if you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley yes they have the menu linen silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable there was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and thats it i have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no wifi on this flight you get a pillow duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit ba has the new planes and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service i will not pay to upgrade to business on ba and will avoid flying with them if i have another option they need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers
913,madrid to london good improvement this ba club europe flight was on a b so seats were flat beds ba have updated their menus so instead of serving a sandwich they offered a full meal service three choices of main and food was good quality good ba listened to feedback they were as always let down by their iberia partners in that their madrid business lounge was abysmal as usual with no toilets available and the lone tortilla as the unique culinary offering along with dirty tables
914,london to munich the ground staff were very friendly and the plane was clean once boarding was completed we were informed that due to issues with the tower the flight would be delayed by minutes they hadnt finished loading the baggage and this was clear from the view out of the window where you could see bags still arriving and being loaded after our scheduled departure aircrew were functional but this must have been the last flight of the day and you noticed it flight was uneventful they had the flight tracking screen down for minutes before they retracted other than being lied to as to the reason for the delay the flight offered the minimum required
915,london to cape town waiting at gate the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high air conditioning problem on board she said all doors of aircraft have been opened lights dimmed or switched off to decrease temperature boarding will start as soon as possible finally one hour after take off temperature became acceptable
916,full flight from muc to lhr with british airways on the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly so is the baggage allowance plane although not new was clean you have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights the departure was delayed by minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of minutes later than expected we also parked at a gate at the very far end of t the plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us service as expected for the price and that would be the reason for choosing them again when traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters
917,manchester to philadelphia via london manlhr i am not tall so the club europe seating is fine for me on a short flight addressed by name adequate breakfast of bacon roll fruit and yoghurt concorde room not crowded and no wait for showers lhrphl on aged but still my favorite cabinwashrooms in very good shape though i have no problem with the ba f layout unlike so many posters here excellent flight experienced crew and though full cabin all very smooth and professional beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank good wines as always nice to see a good british bubbly included only downside was deplaning in phl where f passengers had to fight their way off through the j scrum could have been controlled by crew but was not
918,bangkok to london seating and interior old with a very small ife screen i did not like the meals had a short connection and i was rebooked from another partner upon arrival in lhr others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me i was told there would be service agents in purple everywhere but i found none the fast track security was non existant total experience was bad
919,london to toronto day trip to play golf with my father and ba lost my clubs for days dealing with ba lost luggagecustomer service was brutal they had no idea where my clubs were or how long it would take to retrieve them i had packed all my clothes with my clubs first days of trip were to buy clothes and essentials flight home from lhryyz was an old with a misplaced seat cushion and a broken seat that wouldnt stay upright the ife system badly needs upgrading and no power ports at the seats grueling hr flight as bad as i thought air canada was they are light years ahead of ba
920,london to vienna i was shocked that ba provides buy onboard short haul flights no free water coffee or tea i tried to buy something but my credit card wouldnt work and i could not pay with cash
921,johannesburg to london i tend to stay with an airline as a frequent flyer and i fly business class i have seen a change for the worst in ba service and it does not seem to get any better bedding finally a decent pillow a very good one indeed the rest is a waste of money unless a new announced club world seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly seated in a window seat makes it impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things i dont expect top food in a plane but i expect service if you announce things make sure you have them on some flights champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat premium economy however gets a sparkling wine you must eat when they order you to eat they seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than gordons you have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner entertainment make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view ba offers you the most limited offer
922,singapore to london heathrow its my first time traveling on british airways the seat arrangement in its longhaul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward so you are facetoface with the one sitting opposite you at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down there are club world seats per row for er which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route the cabin service was as good as expected however i saw only chocolate bars and sweets for the minibar during night there could be some other choices
923,london to los angeles booked this trip eight months previously and as i lost my status on ba a few years ago were forced to pay an additional for our two seats the flight i chose was a boeing and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin never expecting anything to go according to plan with ba and our flight was cancelled a few days before we were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an a to a twenty one year old jumbo we were then seated right at the back of club world to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium we were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip he then disappeared never to be seen again food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight the steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off after a few hours i went to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink the second meal was served about seven hours after lunch steak sandwich at least that one was edible the seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered getting out was a task in itself i bought wifi for the whole trip it ran for about of the flight yet their customer non existent services refuse to refund the payment even though i sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service but they are happy to note the problems we have avoided ba now for some time except where there is no other option as on club europe but with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile we only took this trip to use up some avios they have all been used now and we could come back from lax on virgin atlantic never again ba club world offered is a farce in todays business market
924,miami to london heathrow as with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with bas customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline my issue was with faulty equipment onboard issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy had to move seat and as first club and premium economy all full had to move back to economy asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear ba lacks consistency and dont wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong as i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think ba now need to work on their problem solving skills i now have avios going to waste as my business will be going else where
925,london heathrow to milan malpensa worst airline ive ever dealt with i fly times a year british airways lost my and my wifes luggage on our vacation they have been unbelievably rude and unhelpful in resolving this issue they have ruined our vacation and refuse to help us please never book this airline
926,calgary to rome via london my wife and i booked our th anniversary trip from calgary to rome return with british airways sept this was my first trip in europe and we spent almost cad on first class tickets the flight calgary to london stopover was ok i got a bottle of water and then nobody came to the pod i was in for the next hours one would have expected more from first class maybe another bottle of water they asked me to fill out what i would like for breakfast on a card i filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came the vacation itself was great on the day of the return flight our trenitalia train broke down in naples and we were mins late my wife tried dozens of times to phone british airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service we tried the numbers from our tickets their website their help desk facebook page google etc we tried at least different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the mins and could not get through my wife managed to check herself in online but could not check me in there was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in once my wife pressed my name the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete it was a computer glitch we couldnt get around ultimately we arrived at the rome airport mins too late for me to check in my wife was ok and could go through but i could not we asked the ladies at the british airways desk for help and they shrugged and said they couldnt help us apparently they said it would have been different if we called before and we showed them her phone see the attached photos with all the calls we made they then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldnt reschedule us they gave us another number to call my wife at this point was near tears i am visually impaired and had eye surgery just weeks prior so i was not allowed to carry over lbs she was managing all the luggage the ticketing etc and after hours of delays she was very stressed the attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way the new secret customer service phone number we were given did work and my wife was on the phone with customer service for over an hour after reviewing the details with several teams of specialists we were told basically that they didnt believe us that we tried to call they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call nothing could be done for us and they could only rebook us for no apologies whatsoever were given nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in rome we eventually made it home on different airlines but i have lost all respect and trust for british airways like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support
927,london to bangkok flew british airways for the first time in a couple of years terminal is rubbish it may look great but you have to travel further using the train services to get there and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel again on another train to ta or b as they are again separate sections of terminal i usually fly eva and others from terminal and i would avoid t if possible from now on the aircraft interior was old and dated the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iphone without the technology the food was ok at best served cold to warm on both meals on both flights the crew were okay on the flight home however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them landing cards for thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about so most people in economy had to land in bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag the flight had some drunks on the way back to the uk and while this isnt the airlines fault i did notice that when one young guy of about was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager he kicked off the next crew member did serve him this is the last time by choice i will ever fly british airways if theres no seats available anywhere else which is why i went with them this time then i guess ill have no choice
928,london heathrow to miami the airport staff was very helpful the crew was also very nice and the food was delicious i had the old personal entertainment system but it works very well overall it was one of the best flights i had
929,london to singapore it was a wonderful flight i was lucky having a seatsrow for my own on the upperdeck but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfect the crew was very friendly and the food was the best ive had on an airplane if you fly the a in economy book seats in the upperdeck best seats on the plane a or k
930,dublin to london i was trying to add additional bag online but system was keep saying that my email address is not correct but i was giving completely correct email address when i checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me as compare to online price afterwards i phoned customer care to discuss the issue customer care agent has dropped my call three times on fourth time i was talking one of the customer care agent he was not helpful at all then i asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager they put me on hold for about mins and said manager is busy this is completely unprofessional and was showing no empathy british airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra baggage british airways was always my first priority unfortunately i wont be flying again with british airways due to this awkward behavior
931,london pisa return i fly this route often as we have a house in tuscany this in all reasonableness was the best so far but only just outbound we went through the first wing check in at t we are gold card members the breakfast we had in the lounge was just about ok the south lounge was rammed we took off on time and i declined a cooked breakfast the lady next to me had a full english and it did look rather nice the captain popped out for the loo and i caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation a very nice bloke who landed the plane superbly coming home we were delayed by minutes due to storm ali we had a very good lunch with the new club europe menu which came into effect two days earlier a nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation chicken downed a couple of gts fas on both flights were great there has been a massive improvement here on the catering side the seating is still hopeless three seats between two and zero legroom ba really should look at the competition in the far east who offer excellent regionalized business class the product is only worth it in a sale or avious points the every day fare price is ludicrous
932,i was in prague flying british airways back to heathrow apparently there were thunderstorms in london so the flights were being delayed my flight was delayed until am the next morning there was no british airways person at the prague airport to relay this message some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the am flight the sheet of information didnt offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into prague this consolidator also mentioned that there was a flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight so after calling british airways and finding their offices were closed for the evening i went online and booked the flight because of the late timing i was charged usd then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone i finally learned that ba would only reimburse me the nonused flight that i had booked months earlier at a cost of usd they also said they would send me a flight voucher not sure how many months it will take until i receive it is there any other airline that doesnt simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them i will never fly british airways again
933,ba kullhr sept return ba lhrsinkul on sept all flights in world traveller plus with the exception of sinkul on mh economy on the kullhr leg the aircraft was clean and spacious in the py cabin the seats were the biggest let down whilst there was adequate legroom they were hard and uncomfortable especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support the headrest did not move at all the seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which i think is a missed opportunity by ba to maximise utilisation of space the food was okay you get two meals the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke ife was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging the return flight was on an a excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight again seats were the same but the a has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin staff were less conspicuous this time around overall i would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats
934,we flew from los angeles to leeds bradford via heathrow on thursday th september with british airways and codeshare partner american airways we arrived safely but our bags did not it is now monday afternoon and after receiving five different text messages contradicting each previous one we are still without our bags come on ba sort this shambles out
935,brindisi to london flying from any airport that includes ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for club europe passengers there was also no priority checkin or indeed priority anything boarding was a fiasco with two lines directed into pens pending the mad dash to the plane which then entailed using a rather weird tiered set of steps that was just another queue service in club europe commenced efficiently but the cabin crew were of the breezy cheery type whod have been better suited to ryanair the brief drinks service over it was on to the the muchvaunted new look club europe meal service sadly this proved to be just another costcutting exercise with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once and the appetiser and cheese courses reduced to microscopic portions in little pots and of course the seats havent changed although interestingly ba seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the club europe section which means that the service is little different to the old economy still we arrived only minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes its just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and unbusinesslike
936,chicago to london i have flown long haul many times with both ba and virgin premium economy in my view whilst the virgin product has improved the ba equivalent has deteriorated such that virgin is significantly better despite booking and paying for seats with ba this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of wt on the a which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight for the first time in many years i found the food inedible and the service not great for example no cutlery initially on tray no food choice as had run out of other choice one drink serving and no where to get water on flight went through layers of customer service with ba on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg
937,berlin to london it was a connecting flight so i should not complain the flight was on time and the machine clean and they do not serve free water let alone tea or coffee while this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customers ba simply turned into a low cost airline
938,british airways is my favorite airline boeing was years old but clean the staff was professional food was above expectation during hours flight staff is always there captain kept updating us about weather turbulence and time
939,rome to newark via london the first sector was on a a flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time boarding at fco was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups and flight attendants friendly and welcoming seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight there was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased even water no entertainment either was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the ms menu connection at t was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon boarding for the flight to newark was organised and painless i was dreading this flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped happy to say the seat comfort was pretty good legroom was manageable i was however surprised that for a year old aircraft i checked it was pretty dirty there was grime around the usb port which didnt work tv screen and along the floor by the wall the cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well i found the touchscreen ife to be outdated and slightly slow in response the selection was not as extensive but i did find some excellent british content that i had not seen before the real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly professional and warm they were with their service they were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick the main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing all in all a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector
940,london heathrow to new york jfk the first wing at terminal was rubbish tonight or so deep and its really the only decent part of bas ground operation flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at kennedy made us overall late staff very cheerful this route gets decent catering normally but only main options and the indian chicken was very bland
941,london heathrow to dubai this was the first time i had flown in first class on ba i had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed bas first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isnt the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates we were on a which is probably one of the oldest in the ba fleet the cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious the sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy it is nice they offer a male and female kit my wife was delighted with the contents the champagne that ba offer in first is superb i enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne i have tasted choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the johnnie walker blue label if you are a whiskey drinker food was very tasty and well presented i had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then lamb machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille we were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing i cant really fault any of it it was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too ife was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing i believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the i do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice the thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew from the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous attentive with out being overbearing witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need they were superb wifi was available but the page to connect didnt load up when i tried it i dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer this was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first whether i would choose it over club world would be on flight by flight basis you have to do it once though
942,heraklion to gatwick left my luggage behind on the belt by mistake mins after i realised i went back to the airport but no british airways staff was willing to help asked me to ring a phone from the arrival hall pillar dialed for ba baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered again this is so frustrating
943,flew madrid to london heathrow the is ancient and ba have clearly given up on hiding that fact i guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon i love flying in s the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and ba should definitely improve this aside from this the flight was really very good indeed ba business class has in my experience always been consistent consistently good ba cabin crew in business class are a real asset this was one of bas more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere the flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks ill be sad to see the s go but the time has come
944,london heathrow to brindisi we werent expecting the long queue for club europe checkin but midafternoon is apparently particularly busy in t galleries south lounge was also teeming but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food group boarding was handled efficiently the a was relatively new and clean no pretakeoff drinks were offered departure was delayed by about minutes but arrival was on time the club europe section was unusually busy with at least ten fully occupied rows including families with preschool children despite the congestion and chaos the food and drink service was handled efficiently although the food was no better than the old world traveller offering its hard to see the point of bas short haul business class product when the experience is second rate
945,i have ba silver membership this promises fast track choice of seats at booking priority boarding and lounge access i would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst the majority of the time my seat choice is changed fast track at heathrow is slower than the normal queue and the lounges so overcrowded that its sometimes hard to find a seat the iberia lounge at madrid is equality poor with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast british airways is a rip off i have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their a and seat c this seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others yet on bacom they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom i recently travelled on virgin atlantic and cathay pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal baiberia are by comparison
946,hamburg to london initial flight from london cancelled from under us days from departure and we had a firm booking to collect a motorhome upon arrival total chaos ground service appalling and no free service on board checkin from hamburg appallingly slow and didnt open until hrs from departure check in demanded that cabin baggage be checked in while we demanded we keep it all in all an unsatisfactory airline
947,glasgow to miami via london glasgow to heathrow was painless as was transfer to t heathrow to miami on aging flight delayed by an hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe to board kept informed by gate team about progress tv screen tiny and poor choices of entertainment plane was looking its age and a bit run down around the edges premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on a what made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin polite efficient welcoming and nothing was any bother for her service with a smile from start to finish people in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job also meals and drink selection very good although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done ba and looking forward to return journey
948,london heathrow to budapest after so much disappointing experience with ba this was finally a nice flight i got an emergency seat assigned at the online checkin though these are usually for extra money on top of this no one sat next to me so i had better seat than the people in euro club business class since their legroom is the same as on economy class the flight departed and landed in time and was uneventful anyway
949,budapest to london heathrow the flight departed in time and would have arrived ahead of schedule if the gate had not been occupied by the previous aircraft the ride was a bit bumpy but was not too serious the flight was full with kids and the crew did everything to make the journey smooth i did not purchase any food but i saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of onboard purchases
950,london to toronto group of people age from to over business class seating in very conducive for family travelling allows for interaction forward business class cabin on is fairly private service on both flights was flawless very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the meals food presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantastic outstanding crew on ba and ba on our outgoing flights from toronto on august similar great service ba gets often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a bad experience their seating arrangement in club world is perfect when travelling with family other carriers may have an advantage if one travels alone
951,madrid to heathrow i fly with ba on a regular basis and am a gold card holder their service attitude and facilities drop lower and lower the planes are filthy not cleaned properly between flights the staff are hit and miss but more miss than anything and very poorly turned out the food in business is average and the seating in the newer planes is terribly uncomfortable and as for customer service there is no point in ringing them they are useless rude hostile and will never provide any assistance whatsoever
952,singapore to london they wanted to charge me an extra gbp for being over the kg limit the legroom seemed very small to me the flight was super full and i was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat i was asked if i would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come back with the tea after a long time i managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea
953,washington to frankfurt via london checkin at dulles airport was smooth i asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did even though at the online checkin there was none available boeing was years old the ife was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad the seats were ok pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good my seat was a and i had the whole row for myself unfortunately a crew member shortly before takeoff told me that another passenger had issues with his ife and they would replace him on c shortly after takeoff the service began there were food options available chicken and vegatarian lasagne i went for the lasagne which was ok nothing special it came with a salad a bread bun and a black forest cake all in all an ok meal nothing to complain about the crew distributed mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying after dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep i tried to watch some movies the selection was ok which was hard on this miniature ife in the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle connecting in heathrow is pretty easy in t there are signs everywhere security went fast there is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free wifi we boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds ba started to do a buyonboard service which i hate however i thought the pricing was ok
954,rome to london our flight was delayed from rome by an hour and we could not connect to the next flight to los angeles as we landed in heathrow minutes before the departure there were no staff members who helped us and they have conveniently put us on the next flight tomorrow they put us on a hotel next to airport and provided dinner but did not provide additional vouchers for snacks and other stuff
955,i always like travelling on a ba a seats in economy class are comfortable and always able to sleep which is rare on other airlines or types of planes however the food is really poor in the last months i have had some of the worst airline food served from ba or cathay pacific and this includes my most recent travels with british airways thankfully ba airline staff are always the best
956,london heathrow to dsseldorf really good crew on both legs of the journey got to board first and let crew know about the fact i was flying solo with slight autism and they kept me safe the entire flight which was a bonus loved the fact that they asked if i was ok on board too
957,london to athens since i started using ba in i can only say that the quality becomes worse the leg room in business class in a is the same like in economy the only thing that you get is an empty middle seat the meal choices are poor i had to choose between curry and fish pie also they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after mins once we ate the starter they took the starter plate and they gave us the main the on board service is less attentive than some years ago probably cabin crew are overutilised and want to get some rest which is understandable also due to the plane being late the cabin was not cleaned properly at some point we need to think why would someone choose ba over low cost airlines tickets are priced in a similar way there is no food on board for the economy while for business the portion and variety are a joke leg space is small there are always delays to depart from heathrow not bas fault but at the end of the day i experience delays what is that makes ba in european flights distinct probably nothing
958,london heathrow to singapore had a great experience in the concorde room and galleries first lounges in heathrow t i was warmly greeted by a member of the crew who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around all because i expressed a slight interest and for that i am thankful the flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit the seat was very well presented there was a small amenity kit as well as a pair of pyjamas the seat was clean with pillows as well as ample storage space you get a closet to hang clothes a little compartment next to the seat as well as the overhead bin so i never ran out of room the predeparture beverage was a choice of water orange juice or champagne and hot towels were handed out the flight left slightly behind schedule but at heathrow this is something you expect very soon after takeoff the crew began serving dinner i had already booked my meal in advance but the choice of starters mains and deserts as well as the beverage menu was very good the meal i had was exceptionally tasty and i would have it again once dinner service had finished the crew turned down the bed for me whilst i went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided the bed was very comfortable and at just over feet tall i did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out there were plenty of blankets and pillows available and i slept very well when i awoke i was offered coffee and a short while later breakfast the breakfast choices were continental or cooked i opted for the cooked option and i was not disappointed as it was very tasty and there was a lot of it the inflight entertainment was good and there was a large range of films tv programmesseries audio books and kids programmes to choose from the system was responsive and was good quality although i did not watch any films so i cannot speak of the sound quality the crew served with a smile and even when i asked for a latte which the machine didnt do the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice they really made this already special experience even more special if you want to treat yourself to ba first i would thoroughly recommend it
959,philadelphia to london nice plane nice seats low quality service on the plane both my husband and i ordered low sodium meals his was delivered mine was not when asked the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray lsml obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm dry and i was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food not the same as my husbands meal so i have to take the airlines word lsml that it was low sodium attendants serving coffee missed us and when i pressed the call button it was over minutes before a flight attendant showed up one pass through the cabin for drinks after that you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous hummus limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least i expected edible food and better more friendly service with this airline our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal before landing many people still had trash but no final walk through by our invisible flight crew i thought british airways was better than this
960,london to las vegas i experienced an ancient entertainment unit that was inoperable and could not be reset the tray table did not stow properly so the armrest remained at a degree angle with the metal frame exposed the seat cushion was so badly sunken it was as if totally unpadded one air vent for the seat row and no inseat power luggage was mislaid for hours even with priority tag after writing to british airways regarding disappointing flight ba customer service contacted me and offered an apology and a usd voucher toward future ba travel to make up for their shoddy service if you have a choice choose another airline
961,zagreb to london and during the checkin hours before i checked in via app i was offered no choice of seating during the flight i was asked by stewardess if i would like any food i find that approach not pleasant at all i was not personally invited to use the lounge i find that lacking for a business class fare
962,i booked a round trip from milan to california for my honeymoon first flight milan to san francisco via london while returning flight was from los angeles to milan always via london both flights faced hour delay and in both flights our luggage were not delivered at destination when you check in the bags business class is mixed with other one world members so it is not exclusive at all only first has some real advantages we found business lane crowded for the category worst business class experience and totally disappointed
963,toronto to lhr and lgw to toronto return in wt finally ba has moved back into its own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture however premium plaza still staff and operate the lounge food was ok but the drinks choices remain poor slick boarding and a full pe cabin on a water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights to london apparently are loaded in london for the ow leg but none for the return friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service fast bar service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul salty dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables the salad is a nonsense a few leaves and a tomato slice pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross got a couple of hours sleep however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working a reset halfway through the flight worked though two loud renditions of delibes flower duet burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up the standard tcs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is ba should be embarrassed that its even offered after leaving toronto mins late we arrived early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags for the return leg i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security even in the fast track lane gatwick airport sell premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying quid mixed in with ba fast track customers excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food and champagne available as a help yourself efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew a fast offering of champagne with a top up before take off though the old safety video was still showing the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow more experienced faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service fast bar service once airborne followed by the old biz food service overcooked steak again alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option plenty of wine and drinks along with tc after a pleasant hour nap i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream off the menu due to supply issues at the gate early and fast bags too this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu i hope gatwick catches up so ba dont unintentionally promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative on the ow leg premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp the food is truly awful both dinner and breakfast and it really wouldnt take much to add better food bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat all that said i felt that ba is regaining its mojo with great crew improved on board experience cuts reinstated and on time performance long may this improvement last
964,san francisco to london heathrow on the lower deck of the a a very quiet smooth flight did not want to pay the usual ba extortionate seat prereservation fees but still got seats together after the real scrum at the departure gate no apparent order struggle to get through to priority lane announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable if narrow seats of course the usual ba club class scramble over the legs to get to the aisle and abreast not really a premium product in todays competitive business class world welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive fa ok meal beef with decent wines to accompany much more up to date touch screen avod system but still a dreadful choice of blockbuster films very extensive choice for breakfast continental and cooked if you wanted it really very good fas made you feel welcome landed on time but baggage for some reason took about hour to get to the belt as usual i have mixed feelings about ba if we are lucky enough to fly clubbusiness class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to prereserve seat if virgin atlantic fly the same route i will always choose their upper class as everyone has aisle access and you dont have to pay to prereserve your seat
965,london to dublin this was an early morning departure from heathrow on a full flight ba managed everything in a very professional manner the bagdrop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules the cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video during this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression i had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb
966,london to paris i wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it that being said this is better than any lowcost carrier
967,delivering outstanding customer service onboard british airways may not have the cleanest newest or comfortable aircraft but their customer service has always been a delight since i have flown with them
968,this was a night flight new york jfk to london so it was difficult to assess the service onboard although what i experienced was certainly not bad i think this was a very quiet flight judging from the number of people around the gate and there were only another pax in first but its quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin the former felt very exclusive but as commented elsewhere to the point of being fussy its irritating that they dont have any showers in the concorde room i wasnt amused to check in at the galleries business lounge be brusquely sent on to concorde only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former it was pm early august in nyc of course i needed a shower departures from ny were running around hours late that evening due to weather and we were warned about a min taxi to the runway but we were very well looked after at that point the cabin wasnt secured until just before takeoff and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple and very welcome topups of champagne seved by various members of the crew likewise all the perks of first class were there i was addressed by name the crew introduced themselves individually dinner and drinks orders were taken etc all very courteous and professional after such a long delay i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish this came with some excellent wine and was served promptly so there was still plenty of time for sleep but the soup was cold and the main wouldnt have been out of place in business class moreover it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination had i known this i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t arrivals toiletsperhaps you saw me the cabin layout and bed well its easy to find details of this elsewhere online but its certainly nothing special for first class overall a very acceptable flight but i felt that the overlyfussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing where can i have a shower in the morning where will i be having breakfast ive had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects
969,amman to london appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service we are strict vegans so prebooked vegan meals for our flight meals were delivered as usual and had the vegan slip on them but as i was about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was informing me that there was no meat in it i had to explain to her what a vegan was ie no dairy or eggs it turns out that the so called vegan meal had milk and egg in it needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals shortly after they came around with the drinkstrolley so we asked for a coffee with soya milk the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan was said oh i dont think we have that but we have semi skimmed milk i had to reexplain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask when she returned she said we dont provide that sort of thing that was strange because weeks ago on the outbound journey you did so we had no meals no hot drinks and our video screen did not work the customer service that followed from was more appalling they could not care less it took ages to get replies and when i did i was just palmed off after several months of having to write emails i was informed that i had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper which was just another way of getting rid of us so we did this after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation basically the value of the meals that we could not eat in vouchers
970,paphos to london gatwick in club europe we had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed as were many other flights due to bad weather the previous evening in uk we checked in on time only to be advised that there was no lounge available for club europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay whilst we appreciate that there may not be a ba lounge it is normal that ba would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class we were offered a voucher each due to the delayed flight paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with ba that no lounge access was available the flight itself was ok although two hours late the cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable my wife chose the chilli con carne and i chose the roasted chicken both were a little dry on arrival at gatwick at we were through passport control quickly and then waited minutes for the cases to be delivered again very poor show ba has some great assets particularly the cabin crew but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight like us many travellers like to travel with a full service airline and in this case ba were lacking
971,gatwick to paphos in club europe we travelled on the first saturday of the school holidays and whilst gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad we expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats the flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue we are used the bas club europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable service from the cabin crew was good it is nice that ba have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in club europe and now serve by the glass the meal service was quite good we both chose the chicken curry for the main course which was tasty and not dried out flight arrived minutes ahead of schedule very happy with the service
972,new york to nairobi via london flight attendants were wonderful friendly cheery and helpful but the business class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger even if you are seated next to a companion there is no easily accessible storage space by the seat even for a bottle of water the ife on the lhrnbo leg reminds me of the game pong in its resolution and food is mediocre at best ba charges to select business class seats for my family of it would have cost over to get assigned seats on the segments
973,istanbul to london heathrow the plane itself was old i found the food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane back had to be checked in for security purposes this meant that when i was at ataturk airport we had no less than separate security checks before check in one after check in and one before getting on the plane because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the hours on the plane norwegian offers free wifi so i could check my phone on the plane british airways need to improve their service levels
974,bad service and attitude all round my fiasco was when my flight from london was cancelled due to failure of their systems ba refused to rebook us at the airport instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to milan via madrid a day later ba are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel food and refreshment costs we were stranded at the airport no help to find a hotel zero customer care or empathy premium prices for a ryanair style service
975,london to santiago de chile i was flying premium economy with ba and surprised that i got a row seats on the left side for my own the seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat i would have had enough space to feel very comfortable however lufthansa on the a also y gives a bit more personal space at least it seems to me the seat recline was good as well as the ife system big screen wide choice of programs of which i chose to listen to some bbc concerts the crew didnt impress me but was very friendly and helpful the food was extraordinarily good the chicken i had was very delicious with sufficient food cheese salad dessert the frittata on breakfast wasnt good however i didnt like that they sealed the drinks minutes before the arrival a bit early i had a good experience with ba and would definitely fly again as all the things seat ground service staff were like expected the dinner was way above average premium economy is a good value for money especially on a hrs flight
976,flew a now ageing b flight ba to seattle pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal ok choice of wine beer with meal and greeted with glass of prosecco when boarded comfortable seat but its the old bug bear across with over the legs access to the aisle fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access and we could look at each other and not at a total stranger i know ba are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in club class but this cant come soon enough and abreast is not exactly a premium product in the present circumstances is it absolutely terrible in flight entertainment system although it was on demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system blurry old screens awful audio take your own noise reducing headphones and a pretty dreadful choice of movies fas great welcoming and gave good service but the main drawback with ba is their insistence that having paid for a premium service we then have to pay handsomely again to prereserve our seats up to per seat per journey not what i expect from a flag carrier airline we refuse to pay this extortionate sum our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far so although we had quite a pleasant flight to seattle with ba in club if virgin atlantic fly the same route we will choose their upper class over clubworld we can still reserve our seats for free with them
977,flew london gatwick to tirana rinas bag drop at gatwick was basically seamless and ba was offering to check in your hand baggage for free the flight was at and the gate was supposed to be shown at am which was oddly specific but as we got closer to that time that just got more and more delayed until we finally got our gate info at around for which boarding had already started boarding was pretty much seamless the cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice the legroom was alright perfectly fine for a and and a half hour flight good recline aswell i dont understand why british airways opted for buy on board their free food offering before was perfectly fine although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive and there was no real hot food options just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot flights were on time flights cost around return per person which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price so overall its a good option but if you can find something cheaper then go for it
978,london heathrow to murcia and back a few problems at heathrow with the wrong gate being shown ba ground staff didnt seem to care this was an issue but the flights were excellent comfortable and on time i really dont mind paying for the food and drink inflight especially as you can pay using avios murcia airport also a joy small efficient and friendly i will only fly ba on short haul in europe very impressed
979,london to amsterdam bas service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years but tonights experience really takes the biscuit i should now be in amsterdam however i am still writing this from london despite spending over hours on a plane to nowhere we boarded just about on time around only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so shortly after we were told that the routes north of lhr were shut and no planes were taking off about an hour into the ordeal we were told that the airspace had reopened but there would be a minute wait for a slot one more hour in we were told airspace was shut again after hours good news or so we thought we were to be on the move around minutes or so later we did then leave the gate and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that ams would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived so our flight wad cancelled we taxied back to the gate where we waited a further minutes for ground staff to become available i must say during this and a quarter odd ordeal the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat and the cabin crew were very good the crew gave us the inflight service minus alcohol so we were well fed and watered this is the full extent of my praise though little was i to know that the real disaster was still to come bas ground handling was attrocious we were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings however ba had cancelled around flights and the queues were very lengthy vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because all the rooms were full i have never heard anything like it this is beyond unbelievable no assistance for children elderly and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers as is the norm in this situation further the promised rebooking staff had all gone home i was told to consult the ba app the following morning bas app has rebooked my flights two days later when my trip was for three days total the feature on the app to select a different date for my flights so i can replan my trip for another weekend is broken i guess ill be trying out their call centre in the morning this is all simply appalling we all understand that adverse weather happens but to keep us on a plane for hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on moreover ba surely know the opening hours of their destination airports why they could not have prioritised the ams flight over flights to hour airports i do not know and as for the ground handling i have never had an experience this bad ba staff themselves were thin on the ground they left most of the work to heathrow staff who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the we dont work for ba excuse ive had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review because they genuinely couldnt have handled it better by contrast i dont see how ba could have handled this worse they really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days save for the good lounges if you fly business
980,aberdeen to abu dhabi via london despite being a gold member of the executive club i try to avoid british airways these days and now ive reminded myself why flight crew dont afford old fashioned courtesy or service im not saying they are rude just that they dont provide a decent level of customer service you get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention they walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact no bags at the other end on arrival which i guess you have to live with however the way they deal with it is appalling couldnt care less i feel hr delay on return flights seems ba is unsure if they want to be a budget airline or a true contender
981,prague to denver via london i almost missed my flight because at checkin i had to complete some really important papers that took minutes later no one asked me for those papers flight to heathrow was average what you expect from a hour flight at heathrow the security lasted me minutes when i boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room it was less than the flight before the flight then was pretty much okay the food was delicious had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks the flight staff was kind and helpful but the plane had no paid wifi no outlets or usb ports the screens were low quality
982,seville to gatwick if it wasnt for avios and the fantastic deal that this can make flying ba if you collect them and use executive club for award tickets within europe i would never fly ba given the current product the cabin was old cramped and dirty the cabin crew were abrupt and surly the buyonboard is still a massive bugbear we were on award tickets but think it is unacceptable for food not to be complimentary
983,london to amsterdam a delayed ba flight by mins old airplane unhelpful staff delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays another terrible show from british airways
984,gatwick to barcelona check in efficient and friendly and helpful staff staff very welcoming in lounge and on board flight however the in flight product has deteriorated salad ran out so no food option for business class passengers had to have sandwich seats dirty and no middle seat tray although business class no priority boarding for business passengers really disorganized at boarding calling people by groups and lines becoming mixed up on arrival no bags and trying to get update but no update trying to get update on baggage after hours but no update
985,i thought it time ba deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these days i was fortunate to travel hong kong to london return in premium economy recently being able to checkin at the downtown hong kong airport express station is a real bonus as is using the good qantas lounge at hong kong i found the onboard service and operations a lot improved over the last time i flew longhaul with ba the new group boarding sequence system mostly seems to work although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates food and wine onboard was quite good and overall service excellent including recognising my one world status ba has the best inflight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever inflight programs i also particularly welcomed the excellent service from goswami who found me a window seat for lhrhkg when returning and when using the first lounge at heathrow allin all made for an enjoyable experience a rarity these days
986,faro to gatwick club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at faro ba now do have use of a rd party lounge here which sadly is absolutely awful it feels like an average office canteen with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there its really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport its a pathetic offering food was minimal and basic drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available whilst ba do provide priority boarding they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this once on board i have similar comments to my outbound flight in my opinion they should provide a better welcome a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier at one point i dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone elses seat i was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all instead just looking mildly annoyed that i was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it priority disembarkation and baggage at gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly
987,gatwick to faro club check in at gatwick is very quick and easy and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge the lounge itself is really nice spacious enough to have plenty of seating available and different types of seating but it also feels very cosy and welcoming the lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam as always the drinks offering in ba lounges was great the new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and ba staff are finally enforcing the priority system long may it continue on board was the usual club europe offering which while not exactly luxury is standard for europe now and for a hour flight is fine ba dont ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind its a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier i would also like to see menus handed out before take off which could be done at the same time as a welcome the food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price but a few small touches would make it feel much better
988,jeddah to chicago via london the flight from jeddah to heathrow wasnt as good as i expected ground staff at jeddah some of them were rude also the new baggage restriction for the flights to the uk made the trip uncomfortable i had to check my carryon bag at the gate because my laptop charger and the power bank were there they took my laptop when i dropped my bags and they told me there is no need to take the chargers however the crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too the flight from lhr to chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generous i wont fly with ba again until they change their baggage restrictions for the saudi flights
989,london to frankfurt i need to fly ba for business frequently as i dont have other choices not only planes are delayed as today but the lounges in heathrow are a joke i dont use them anymore as they are overcrowded and they dont serve proper food just snacks their customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requests their business class in europe is economy class with a free seat next to you
990,gatwick to malaga when booking the tickets i realised that by choosing certain flights in club the fare was cheaper than economy once i had added suitcases and pay for food onboard i hadnt flown ba club in europe for a while and was looking forward to it i was nicely impressed my outbound flight was a wetlease by titan but this was the full ba service the crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet i was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drinks the only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly
991,bermuda to gatwick usual window and aisle seat taken crew friendly enough but when all meal options had cheese including sandwiches not good when someone cannot eat cheese breakfast usual offering ok but not really worth the money paid seats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for ba to offer seats so people do not need to pole vault over other passengers legs to get out from the window seat in the night
992,aberdeen to boston via london heathrow i found the seats werent wide enough and leg room was restricted on the way back to london the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room i had to move also the narrower seats meant that i really had to avoid taking up both arm rests otherwise they were good flights with slightly odd choices but decent food extensive entertainment optionsvariety as well
993,london to hamburg baggage selfcheckin was diabolical machines were either slow or not working boarding commenced early resulting in on time departure seat for this short flight was quite comfortable and better than most european carriers however the total lack of any kind of refreshment was poor i dont expect a meal but even a drink of water would have been something crew were friendly and the flight on time
994,flew london heathrow to hong kong with british airways flew premium economy and the experience was anything but check yourself in create and scan your own baggage labels and load them onto the conveyors yourself unsurprisingly slow process and waited over an hour for the struggling passengers ahead of us in line hardly a ba service attendant in sight better service with ryanair i hate to say it
995,flew to istanbul with british airways on th june at the passportvisa check desk presented printed boarding pass to the ba lady my wife was holding the passports the lady looked at the boarding passes and barked passports as if she did not see my wife holding them second bark do you have a visa third bark show me fourth bark next no smile no hello or good morning hardly any eye contact either if anything the situation was worse at boarding ba recently introduced a boardingbygroupnumber system all such systems need to be policed but there are ways of policing the arrangements some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call when caught by the gate keeper they were told not yet some attempted to board prematurely more than once on the second attempt the staff told them to wait accepting that the system must be monitored ba gate staff should be better trained how to deal with potentially anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands english
996,munich to london heathrow with british airways i booked my flight online about months ahead of my planned travel date and thought i would give this airline another try after a bad experience earlier in the year i give full marks to ba on this occasion in most areas of service i arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile phone had been stolen in a salzburg coffee shop the checkin agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly he was professional and pleasant and very efficient too the flight was on an a and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too the cabin crew were welcoming and orderly although there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressed i bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable arrival was at a remote stand and then a bus overall a very good experience with ba
997,wonderful service on the flight from edinburghflorence on july mainline british airways could learn lots from ba cityflyer and their franchise partner in s africa com air
998,london heathrow to manchester it was outrageous of british airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when i checked in at lhr on the i bought paid and the the booking was confirmed two months before the flight date how dare ba do this to me when i was travelling for hours and everything ran like a clock work different airlines until i encountered ba at heathrow checkin and help desk are arrogant rude and are as miserable as hell not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a voucher and wait till minutes before departure to see if you have a seat we were passengers who had the same treatment from ba british airways is a disgrace of an airline because they have a monopoly on the heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service well they are wrong like others i have found an alternative airline i close my review and say i will never ever use british airways again i would rather walk to manchester
999,london to madrid lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and i not sitting together i understand i can pay to get a seat i want but other than having a seat next to my husband i dont want any particular seat we are travelling as a pair there are three seats each side of the aisle there will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they dont know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit ba bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you dont wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this
